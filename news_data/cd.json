Still, the largest token by market value is likely to become more dominant in the crypto market, according to one analyst.As of the time of writing, bitcoin changed hands at $63,200, representing an 11% monthly loss, the first since August 2023, according to data source CoinDesk and TradingView. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the most liquid digital assets, traded nearly 20% lower for the month at 2,185 points.A bevy of factors like the dwindling probability of the Fed rate cuts, reduced demand for the U.S.-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and broad-based risk aversion in financial markets have taken the wind out of the bitcoin bull run this month. Meanwhile, a continued expansion of prominent stablecoins has been a supportive factor.Analysts are now closely watching Wednesday’s quarterly refunding statement by the U.S. Treasury. According to Singapore-based QCP Capital, a higher issuance of short-term bills could free up liquidity, supporting risk assets.“The upcoming Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA) on May 1 could also see higher issuances of short-term U.S. bills. This will drain the RRP, which currently has USD 400 billion, and also increase liquidity,” QCP said in a market note.The U.S. Treasury said on Monday it plans to borrow more in the April to June quarter. Higher-than-expected borrowing means more bond supply, higher yields or risk-free rates and less reason to invest in risky assets.The Treasury also said it expects to maintain a balance of $850 billion in its Treasury General Account by the end of September, slightly higher than the $750 billion expected.BTC to become more dominantBitcoin’s dominance rate, or the share in the crypto market, recently rose to a three-year high of 57%, breaking higher from a six-month consolidation pattern.The breakout means bitcoin could continue to outshine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) in the coming months.“It [the dominance rate] recently had a breakout favoring bitcoin over altcoins in the intermediate-term, which is in line with the weekly RRG [relative rotation graph] where most altcoins point lower,” Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients Monday.“The breakout in the index marks a continuation of a long-term turnaround phase, which has reversed much of the altcoin gains made in early 2021,” Fairlead Strategies added.The dominance rate looks north, having broken out of a sideways consolidation.

Marshall said that the company isn’t “buying bitcoin or anything of that nature” and is only mining bitcoin with the equipment it has.“We do have some extra capacity that we’re renting out to other bitcoin miners within the data center that we’ve effectively built for this bitcoin mining to take advantage of the low energy costs we have,” he continued.In the grand scheme of things, ARLP’s bitcoin on the balance sheet holdings are relatively small. Data compiled by BitcoinTreasuries.net shows that MicroStrategy has the largest holdings at $13.5 billion.

CoinDesk reached out to bitFlyer for comments and awaited a response at press time.The leading cryptocurrency by market value has consistently drawn a premium in JPY terms in recent weeks. Early this month, the premium rose as high as 1.49%, the highest since March 2020, a sign of traders diversifying into alternative assets to bypass the yen volatility.“Currently, the bitcoin premium on Japanese markets is hovering around 0.3%-0.4%, having declined from over 1% in mid-April and a yearly high of 1.7% reached in mid-March. However, this could change. Overall, FX volatility is rising due to increasingly divergent monetary policy expectations and geopolitical stress, and this could impact crypto,” Dessislava Aubert, an analyst at Paris-based Kaiko, told CoinDesk.The yen swung wildly in a holiday-thinned Japanese trading session on Monday, initially sliding to 160 percentage in points (pips) per U.S. dollar, the lowest in 34 years, only to bounce back 500 pips to 155 pips per USD during the early European hours.The recovery’s speed and magnitude spurred talks of BOJ intervening or selling dollars to put a floor under the yen. Local media neither confirmed nor denied the rumored BOJ action, saying the low liquidity conditions and caution about potential central bank action near 160 pips led to the sudden yen surge.The yen has fallen out of investor favor as burgeoning public debt keeps the Bank of Japan (BOJ) from matching U.S. interest rates.

This starkly contrasts his February prediction that the bullish cycle, starting from the bear market lows in November 2022, could extend out to September 2025, with prices reaching as high as $200,000.The latest projection is based on a statistical concept called “exponential decay,” which describes the process of reducing an amount by a consistent percentage rate over a period.“Bitcoin has historically traded within an approximately 4yr bull/bear cycle, often associated with the halving events. There have been three major bull market cycles since the initial bull cycle and each cycle has been 80% less powerful than its predecessor in terms of the price multiple gained,” Brandt said.“If the statistical constant of the 80% decay holds true, the [record] high in bitcoin of $73,835 of March 14, 2024, has already reached a price consistent with the historical Exponential Decay,” Brandt added.Brandt predicted bitcoin's 2018 collapse to under $4,000.Bitcoin's exponential decay. (Peter Brandt) (Peter Brandt)The table shows the magnitude or gain multiple of previous bitcoin bull runs and exponential decays.The first rally saw prices rise from $0.01 to $31.91, marking a 3,391x increase in less than two years. Subsequent bull markets have been longer in duration but smaller in magnitude, consistently suffering a roughly 80% exponential decay.Bitcoin’s rally to record highs above $73,000 in March marked a 79.1% upswing from the bear market low of $15,473 reached after the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November 2022.So, if exponential decay theory is a guide, the bull market may be over.That said, past data does not guarantee future results, more so, as historically, Bitcoin blockchain’s quadrennial mining reward halvings have bolstered bullish trends. The fourth reward halving took place on April 20, reducing the pace of per-block supply emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.5 BTC.As such, the consensus in the crypto community is that bitcoin’s ongoing consolidation between $60,000 and $70,000 would resolve in a bullish move.\"The ‘Pre/Post Halving’ cycle construct would suggest that the current bull trend will reach a top in the $140,000 to $160,000 range sometime in late summer/early fall 2025,” Brandt said, adding that the thesis remains the primary driver of his bitcoin ownership status.Brandt, however, added that the exponential theory remains on his radar until evidence emerges that “such decay will not influence the bull trend that began in November 2022.”Bitcoin changed hands at $62,300 at press time, down 1.5% on a 24-hour basis.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Ether (ETH) traded 3% lower at $3,200, and the CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the most liquid digital assets, was down 2.6% at 2,197 points.The market appears to be on a precipice right now as it debates which direction to take, with significant bullish and bearish narratives on the horizon.As QCP wrote in a note over the weekend, the threat of stagflation – a period of high inflation and low growth – is very real.\"The weaker than expected [U.S.] GDP print points to a more sluggish economy while the higher Core PCE warns of an inflation problem that continues to be a thorn in the Fed's side,\" QCP wrote.Last week's U.S. GDP report showed the world's largest economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first quarter of this year following the preceding quarter's 3.4% growth. Meanwhile, the personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation metric, showed prices rose to a 3.4% annualized rate in the first three months of the year from 1.8% in the final quarter of 2023.The stagflationary combination of slower growth rate and sticky inflation has further weakened the probability of the Fed rate cuts.Most traders on the prediction market platform Polymarket still see no rate cuts as the most likely scenario, with a 35% chance of this happening, but the chance of 1 rate cut is creeping up, now at 29% versus 26% a week ago and 14% at the start of the month.QCP also wrote that Janet Yellen's fiscal strategy, leveraging the Treasury General Account (TGA)—holding close to USD 1 trillion in assets—and the Reverse Repurchase Program (RRP) with USD 400 billion, could inject up to $1.4 trillion in liquidity into the financial system pushing up all risk assets.As CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole wrote last week, the key to a continuing bitcoin bull market is the U.S. Treasury's impending quarterly refunding announcement, which maintains or reduces the current TGA balance of $750 billion.This $750 billion figure in the TGA is key because it serves as a significant signal to financial markets about the U.S. government's fiscal intentions, profoundly impacting economic stability and growth.Meanwhile, the launch of the bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong on April 30 is also catching the eye of traders. However, news that mainland Chinese investors won't be able to trade the ETFs has dialed down the bullishness of the launch.Edited by Omkar Godbole."

The announcement also discloses the size and duration of the bond issuance, as well as the balance to be held in the Treasury General Account (TGA).The debt issuance plan impacts markets through the yield channel. Higher bond issuance or supply pushes down bond prices and lifts yields, the so-called risk-free rate, disincentivizing risk-taking in financial markets. Reduced issuance has the opposite effect.In its previous announcement dated January 29, the Treasury predicted net borrowing of $202 billion in net marketable debt in the second quarter with a TGA cash balance of $750 billion. That’s down significantly from the first quarter’s net borrowing of $760 billion. Financing needs are typically lower in the second quarter as tax payments fill government coffers.According to Saxo Bank, the upcoming QRA is likely to offer relief, with quarterly gross issuance set to decline from its peak of $7.2 trillion for the first time in two years.“Factoring in upcoming bills and coupon redemptions, and the latest Treasury financing estimates, the total gross issuance of U.S. Marketable Treasury securities is projected to decline for the first time since the second quarter of 2022,” Althea Spinozzi, head of fixed income strategy, said in a QRA preview.“Therefore, the big focus for markets shifts towards announcement concerning the Treasury General Account (TGA) level,\" Spinozzi added.Gross quarterly issuance is set to decline from the peak of over $7 trillion. (WSJ, Securities Industries and Financial Market Association) (WSJ, Securities Industries and Financial Market Association)The TGA is the U.S. government’s operating account maintained at the Federal Reserve to collect tax revenue, customs duties, proceeds from the sale of securities, public debt receipts and meet government payments.The TGA is a liability on the Fed’s balance sheet and must be matched by assets. When the Treasury drains the TGA balance, money moves from the TGA account to bank accounts of individuals and businesses, boosting reserves available with commercial banks. That, in turn, boosts lending, leading to monetary easing in markets and the wider economy. An increase in the TGA balance has the opposite effect.During the debt ceiling drama of early 2023, the Treasury drained the TGA balance as part of extraordinary measures implemented to keep the government functioning. That kept risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, in a bullish trajectory.Per Spinozzi, risk assets will likely rally if the QRA maintains the TGA target at $750 billion or lowers it.“If the TGA is maintained at its current level of $750 billion or lower, it implies no change or the potential release of more funds into the economy, providing a boost to economic activity. This might lead to bullish sentiment in risky assets such as stocks and lower-rated corporate bonds,\" Spinozzi noted.On the other hand, if the debt announcement matches estimates but raises the TGA target, it would mean the government intends to hold more cash. Such an outcome may not bode well for risk assets.Recent tax payments have pushed the TGA balance above the target of $750 billion and closer to $1 trillion. (MacroMicro) (MacroMicro)Arthur Hayes, a co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX and the chief investment officer at Maelstrom, who predicted bitcoin's pre-halving weakness, echoed similar sentiments on X.Hayes explained that the Treasury may stop issuing long-term Treasuries, draining the TGA balance, currently $1 trillion, or issue more short-term bills, unlocking liquidity through the RRP [reverse repurchase agreement] facility. Yellen could also combine both, leading to a liquidity deluge.\"If any of these three options happen, expect a rally in stonks and, most importantly, a re-acceleration of the #crypto bull market,\" Hayes said.The RRP, one of the Fed's liquidity management tool, has been drained since 2022. (MacroMicro) (MacroMicro)The outstanding overnight (ON) reverse repurchase agreements represent the excess cash parked with the Federal Reserve. The balance has been drained rapidly since 2022 from over $2 trillion to under $500 billion, according to data source MacroMicro.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

While most have focused on the ETF inflows, stablecoin inflows have been a more meaningful driver and have kept crypto prices high,\" Thielen told CoinDesk in an interview.\"If stablecoins inflows slow down, then we could see a meaningful correction,\" Thielen added.Over the years, stablecoins, or tokens with values pegged to an external reference like the U.S. dollar, have been widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases and derivatives trading. Hence, the supply of stablecoins is widely seen as a proxy for net capital inflows into the crypto market.The capital has flown into the crypto market via stablecoins at a faster pace than spot ETFs. That's evident from the fact that the combined market capitalization of the top two stablecoins, tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), has increased by $25.6 billion to a record $143.8 billion since the spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on Jan. 11. Meanwhile, the ETFs have amassed over $12 billion since going live on Nasdaq, according to data tracked by 10x Research.Bitcoin ETF and stablecoin inflows since Jan. 11. (10x Research) (10x Research)The chart shows that while inflows into the spot ETFs have slowed in recent weeks, the supply of the top two stablecoins has continued to expand, keeping prices elevated between $60,000 and $70,000.Another source of potential downside volatility could be the \"de-inversion\" of the U.S. Treasury curve, according to Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions.The yield curve, or the term structure of interest rates, shows the yield on bonds with different terms to maturity. Normally, the curve is upward-sloping as investors demand a higher yield for investing or lending money to the government over long periods.Nearly two years ago, the curve inverted, with the two-year note offering a higher yield than the 10-year note as the Federal Reserve rapidly raised interest rates.The yield curve tends to dis-invert at the onset of economic recessions. (TradingView/CoinDesk) (TradingView/CoinDesk)Now, the curve is de-inverting, led by a faster rise in the 20-year yield (also called bear steepening). As of writing, the spread between the 10- and two-year yields stood at -0.28 basis points, the least since January. In other words, the curve is just 28 bps short of normalizing.\"There's always nuance interpreting the curve, but take at face value, it [bear steepening] can imply loss of confidence in either fiscal or monetary policy – or both. For example, it could mean markets see a greater risk the Fed is falling behind the curve or borrowing is becoming unhinged without corresponding demand,\" Solot told CoinDesk.\"That's not a good environment for risk in general, and, at least initially, should weigh on the crypto market as well,\" Solot added, saying the dip would be an opportunity for bitcoin to prove it is a hedge against fiscal and monetary instability.U.S. yield spread and recessions. (MacroMicro) (MacroMicro)The chart shows the spread between the 10- and two-year yields since 1980, with vertical shaded area representing economic recessions or consecutive quarterly contracts in the growth rate.Historically, de-inversions have marked the onset of economic recessions and risk aversion in stocks.According to Phillip Gillespie, managing partner at U.K.-based hedge fund AWR Capital, ultimately, risk assets will find their footing as long as the Federal Reserve continues to support the system with the overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) agreement facility.The overnight RRP is the Fed's tool to remove excess cash from the money market. Since early last year, the RRPP facility has been drained, meaning the once dormant cash is being redeployed, supporting risk-taking in financial markets.\"The Fed is continuing to support the market via overnight reverse repo facility, and although sticky inflation is a problem, there are now even talks of rate cuts given ballooning fiscal deficits and pressure from the government to curb the cost of financing its debts. Risk assets will oscillate here and there with geopolitical flare-ups or upticks in yields, but, in general, risk assets and crypto should be well supported for this year ahead of U.S. elections,\" Gillespie told CoinDesk.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

This is the first step towards actually launching the long-proposed software upgrade.“Getting a BIP number does not signal any sort of consensus on the part of the community,\" Ethan Heilman, one of the co-authors of the proposal alongside Armin Sabouri, said in an interview. \"It just makes discussing and writing software around the proposal easier because the proposal now has a unique numeric identifier that everyone agrees on.”In other words, getting assigned BIP 347 means the argument over the controversial proposal can finally begin in earnest.On one side are those who want to reserve the Bitcoin network simply for monetary transactions; on the other are those who want to build new things on-chain, of which proponents of OP_CAT are just a sliver.OP_CAT has a long history in Bitcoin circles. Initially included as one of the first op_codes (essentially programming shortcuts built into Bitcoin), Satoshi Nakamoto himself removed the functionality in 2010 after concerns were raised about excessive memory usage and the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities.But in recent years, especially following the release of the Ordinals protocol that reinvigorated developers' desire to build on-chain, proponents have returned to OP_CAT as a possible way to increase the amount of things that can be built using Bitcoin. Other proposals include things like Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin’s CTV and feature-rich scaling solutions like Stacks and Ark.See also: Bitcoin L2 Stacks Is Getting a Major OverhaulHeilman and Sabouri began studying reintroducing OP_CAT in 2022, and first proposed launching it a year later on the Bitcoin Mailing List via a backward-compatible soft fork. The idea would be to redefine and expand upon an existing code called “OP_SUCCESS126,” without having to hard fork the chain.If the proposal goes through, OP_CAT covenants could enable the creation of more sophisticated applications and multi-signature setups on Bitcoin. It works by introducing “covenants,” or rules that can be established to determine how a specific transaction will function, to Bitcoin.“Bitcoin allows users to set rules on who and how their bitcoins can be spent. All CAT does is that it joins two values together. So if you have ‘abc’ and ‘def,’ CAT will join these two values together to make ‘abcdef,’” Heilman said, adding that such a basic maneuver isn’t possible today. “The CAT is just shorthand for conCATenate.”“After the community is confident the software works as designed, we will put together a PR into bitcoin-core. This is where the real fun begins because the question changes from ‘is the software correct?’ to ‘does the Bitcoin community want OP_CAT?,’” Heilman said. “This could be a quick process or it could take years.”Among the biggest proponents of OP_CAT have been the co-founders of popular Ordinals project Taproot Wizards, Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, who created the Quantum Cats inscriptions project as a sort of marketing campaign for Heilman and Sabouri’s proposal.While Quantum Cats is one of the most popular inscription projects to date, OP_CAT itself is far from universally accepted. There is some speculation, for instance, that despite Heilman and Sabouri submitting their BIP proposal several months ago, it was being held off from approval by lone BIP editor and Bitcoin Core dev Luke Dashjr, who is not alone in his skepticism of recent on-chain experimentation.On Monday, the Bitcoin community named five additional BIP editors. According to GitHub, OP_CAT's BIP number was assigned by an editor who goes by \"Roasbeef.\"See also: See also: Will Bitcoin's New BIP Editors Streamline Development?Heilman said that now that OP_CAT has a BIP number, it’s up to the community to determine whether it should move forward.“Speaking only for myself, at this point I plan to remove myself from the process and let the community debate if OP_CAT is something they want or not want,\" he said. \"I don't plan to enter that debate except if needed to clarify technical questions.”Edited by Bradley Keoun."

The full design is in process with a leading global semiconductor foundry, according to the post.In addition to that, Block said that after speaking to community members about the pain points in the industry, it decided to also develop a full bitcoin mining system, which will include system design.“We’ve spent a significant amount of time talking to a wide variety of bitcoin miners to identify the challenges faced by mining operators,” it said in the post. “Building on these insights and pursuant to our goal of supporting mining decentralization, we plan to offer both a standalone mining chip as well as a full mining system of our own design.The bitcoin mining industry is dominated by only a few players, with Beijing-based miner Bitmain controlling roughly 60% of the market, according to estimates by CoinShares.“There are few serious competitors, which indicates significant potential for disruption,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.Block announced the completion of a five-nanometer bitcoin mining chip prototype in May 2023, which is the same technology that Bitmain’s S21 mining machine uses. “This leads us to believe that 3nm chips could achieve even greater efficiencies,” he said.Although chip efficiency has rapidly improved in recent years as demand for bitcoin has picked up, the latest halving event on April 20, which cut the issuance of new bitcoin by 50%, adds even more importance for faster mining speed, as well as lower costs and enhances reliability, Butterfill said.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Many merchants “are interested in bitcoin and believe it presents a wide range of use cases, such as long term savings and diversifying their businesses’ holdings,” the company’s press release says.“Many sellers have told us they want an easy way to access bitcoin and diversify their holdings, so we tapped into Block's ecosystem to deliver a solution for them. Bitcoin Conversions automates the process for sellers while still giving them flexibility and control over how they manage their bitcoin,\" Bitcoin Product Lead at Cash App Michael Rihani told CoinDesk in an email.It also presents a potentially lucrative financial service for Block, depending on how many merchants sign up and how much capital is converted per day. At launch, the new service will charge a flat 1% conversion fee – lower than the 2.25% fee Cash App charges for most retail purchases of bitcoin – but still an extra 1% Block can earn on top of existing processing fees.Cash App, one of the most popular ways to onboard users into the bitcoin economy, appears to be emerging as the hub of Block’s Bitcoin-focused efforts. Last month, the company began shipping out pre-orders of its proprietary, non-custodial Bitkey bitcoin wallet, which is connected to Cash App to provide “seamless” BTC purchases and transfers.Block earned a total profit of $1.18 billion on its Cash App business last year, up 25% year over year, including non-bitcoin sales, while Square generated a gross profit of $828 million. The company held approximately 8,038 BTC (worth $531 million at today's prices) as of the end of December.See also: Jack Dorsey's Block Inc.

On Tuesday, the HBAR Foundation, which tries to spur development of the Hedera ecosystem, announced that BlackRock’s ICS U.S. Treasury money market fund had been tokenized on the Hedera blockchain in collaboration with Archax. Hedera supporters on social media began claiming that BlackRock chose Hedera to tokenize its fund, although this wasn’t the case. Archax CEO Graham Rodford said that “it was indeed an Archax choice to put [the fund] on Hedera,” in response to criticism about potentially misleading marketing from HBAR. The token is currently up 50% over the past 24 hours trading at 13 cents.Stablecoin issuer Tether has said it will freeze wallets using USDT to evade sanctions on oil exports in Venezuela. The decision comes after Reuters reported that Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA increased its use of tether to bypass renewed U.S. sanctions on oil exports. The firm froze 41 wallets tied to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list in December. “Tether respects the OFAC SDN list and is committed to working to ensure sanction addresses are frozen properly,” a Tether spokesperson told CoinDesk. PDVSA’s use of USDT, which began last year, has accelerated following the U.S.’s decision to reimpose sanctions due to concerns over Venezuela’s upcoming election.Binance's founder and former chief executive, Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, should spend three years in prison for his role in enabling the crypto exchange to violate federal sanctions and money laundering laws, the U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday night. The former CEO's attorneys argued he should serve no jail time, citing the fine he paid and his \"extraordinary acceptance of responsibility.\" Attorneys with the DOJ filed a sentencing memo arguing he should spend 36 months in prison and pay a $50 million fine after he pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act last November. Hours later, Zhao's defense team filed its own sentencing memo, saying, \"no defendant in a remotely similar BSA case has ever been sentenced to incarceration.\" Instead, they suggested he be sentenced to probation, which could include home confinement at his home in Abu Dhabi. \"The sentence in this case will not just send a message to Zhao but also to the world. Zhao reaped vast rewards for his violation of U.S. law, and the price of that violation must be significant to effectively punish Zhao for his criminal acts and to deter others who are tempted to build fortunes and business empires by breaking U.S. law,\" the filing said.Chart of the DayThe chart shows shares in chipmaker Nvidia have bounced from Friday's two-month low of $843, offering positive cues to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.The 90-day and 52-week correlation coefficient between bitcoin and Nvidia is above 0.80.Source: TradingView.Trending PostsNigeria Directs Entities to Identify Those Dealing Crypto With Bybit, KuCoin, OKX and BinanceIn Mexico’s Biggest Election Yet, Crypto Remains on the SidelinesEther ETFs Are Unlikely to Be Approved in May: Standard CharteredCORRECTION (April 24, 2024, 23:55 UTC): Corrects Hedera item to clarify that the HBAR Foundation, not Hedera itself, made the announcement."

        "content": "The Dollar Index's (DXY) recent pullback has crypto traders betting on a continued weakness in the greenback and a renewed bitcoin rally.Societe Generale and Scotiabank expect the dollar to remain firm due to divergent interest rate expectations.Barclays said a potential escalation of trade war between the U.S. and China could bode well for the dollar.Crypto traders are anticipating a renewed weakness in the U.S. dollar, which would catalyze risk-taking and extend the rally in bitcoin (BTC). However, some banks are forecasting continued dollar strength.Since mid-March, bitcoin has mainly traded between $60,000 and $70,000, CoinDesk data show. The rally in bitcoin, which began in October last year, has paused, likely due to dwindling expectations of Fed rate cuts and a bounce in the dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies.The DXY picked up a bid at 102.35 on March 8 and rose to a five-month high of 106.52 last week, according to data from charting platform TradingView. Since then, it has pulled back slightly to 105.70, giving hope to crypto bulls.“DXY dollar index hit resistance at 106 as expected and has started to turn over. A move back towards 102-103 will turbocharge this rally. The timing makes sense because bitcoin is primed to move to $90,000 in the short term. Longer term, I expect DXY at 92, perhaps by late 2025,” Mike Alfred, a value investor and founder and managing partner at value fund Alpine Fox LP, said on X Tuesday.The U.S. dollar is a global reserve and invoicing currency, playing a major role in international debt, non-bank borrowing, and global trade. When the dollar appreciates, USD-denominated debt becomes expensive, which, in turn, disincentivizes risk-taking in financial markets. A weaker dollar has the opposite effect. As such, over the years, bitcoin and the broader crypto market have tended to move in the opposite direction of the DXY, just as stocks and gold.Jan Happel and Yan Allemann, co-founders of Glassnode, who go by the name Negentropic on X, said the dollar looks to have topped out in an “expanding triangle” pattern and could slide in the coming weeks, powering the crypto market higher.The expanding triangle is identified by diverging trendlines connecting higher highs and lower lows. The DXY has turned lower from the upper trendline resistance and could fall toward 103 next month.Banks bullish on the dollarSome banks, however, do not foresee immediate dollar weakness.According to Societe Generale’s Cross Asset Research Team led by Kit Juckes, the Fed is now unlikely to cut rates before 2025, and that could see the DXY peak somewhere between 107 and 110.“If the market now adjusts to our forecast of lower rates in 1Q25 (and no further hikes), then peak 2s [two-year yield] should be around 5-51/4%, pointing to some, but not much more, DXY upside,” the research team said in a note to clients on April 18.“Overall, if the Fed is on hold for the rest of this year and other central banks ease as expected, the peak DXY level should be in the 107-110 range,” the team added, expressing the possibility of the market overshooting the projected upside target.In October, when the DXY peaked above 107, and bitcoin began the uptrend, markets expected the Fed to cut rates by 100 basis points in 2024. As of now, markets expect less than two rate cuts this year.Scotiabank voiced a similar opinion in a note to clients on April 18, saying, “A higher for longer Fed likely means a strong for longer USD.”U.S. tariffs are dollar bullishCrypto traders might want to monitor potential trade war escalation between the U.S. and China, which could support the U.S. dollar.Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden called for a steep increase in the tariff rate on Chinese steel and aluminum products to 25% from 7.5%. A tariff is a tax levied by governments on the value, including freight and insurance, of imported products and, in theory, adds to inflation.Meanwhile, former President and current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has proposed implementing a tariff rate of 60% or more on Chinese imports.According to Barclays, that could push the dollar higher.“U.S. tariffs tend to support the dollar via the import substitution channel, but the size of the FX impact depends crucially on the details, Barclays’ FX strategy team said in a client note last week.Barclays stress-tested the scenario of the U.S. imposing a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports and concluded that a Trump victory later this year could spark a 3% rally in DXY.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "Bitcoin’s open-source development is an often heralded strength, a show of the network’s resiliency and difficulty to capture. But take a closer look, and anything as complex as developing, updating and patching up a blockchain in real time often has its challenges.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteOne of the main issues for the past couple of years has been the bottleneck in editing BIPs, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, the standard for proposing nonbinding software updates that will somehow change the Bitcoin protocol.That is set to change going forward, after the dispersed, global Bitcoin development community decided to nominate five new BIP editors. The move marks the first time in Bitcoin history where there was more than one person on the job — a role that for the past decade was filled by controversial Bitcoin OG Luke Dashjr alone.Bitcoin Core developer Ava Chow led the nomination process to name the five new editors: Bitcoin dev and Custodia Bank co-founded Bryan Bishop (a.k.a. Kanzure), co-hosts of the bitdevs.org mailing list Murch and Ruben Somsen, Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun (a.k.a. Roasbeef) and Bitcoin Core contributor Jonatack. The months-long search effort was finalized on Monday, after Jonatack made modifications to the BIP GitHub.“The problem was that Luke was the only BIP editor, which means that he's the only person who could merge anything into the BIP repository,” Chow told CoinDesk in an interview. “This ranges from almost no effort to a lot of effort, and it just ended up being that Luke didn't have time for this.”“I think what he does is what he believes to be the best for Bitcoin and what he thinks is most decentralized and best for the whole currency,” Chow added, praising Dashjr’s many contributions over the years. In addition to making regular contributions to Bitcoin Core, Dashjr also serves as chief technology officer of Ocean Mining.BIP editing is a largely unseen aspect of the development process, which includes anything from “trivial things” like fixing typos in proposals to evaluating whether it should be a BIP, assigning it a number and offering detailed feedback, Chow explained. The end of that process would be to merge the BIP into the GitHub repository.“One of the big frustrations is that Luke would comment, like, hey, you need to fix this thing, and the author will fix it in like a few hours. But then we wouldn’t see Luke again on that PR [pull request] for another month or two. Which is really frustrating because like, well, I did exactly what you wanted me to do,” Chow, who has at least four open BIPs, explained.Introduced by early Bitcoin developer Amir Taaki in the first BIP proposal (BIP 0001) in August 2011, the process of submitting improvement proposals has become more formalized over the years — but somehow less streamlined. Bitcoin Core almost never submits BIPs, which tend to focus on things like improving consensus, wallets, key management or in Chow’s case novel transaction types.“The line between what is and isn't a BIP is kind of fuzzy,” Chow said, mentioning proposals like Ordinals, Colored Coins and Taproot Assets, all of which introduce new ways of using Bitcoin, but perhaps do not formally change the protocol. “There's a line in BIP 002 that says something along the lines of BIPs must support Bitcoin — that's super vague, right?”See also: What Are BIPs and Why Do They Matter?In essence, what meets the criteria of being a BIP is a matter for editors to decide, a process that Chow thinks will be made more efficient by adding more voices from more diverse backgrounds. While most of the conversations will likely continue to happen out of the public eye, the greater amount of debate may help better define the criteria for successful proposals.\"The BIPs repository records concrete ideas for reference. A comprehensive, specific description is indispensable for advancing the distributed conversation about a proposal. I hope that more people volunteering time to sight contributions to the BIPs repository will facilitate more efficient discussions about ideas,\" Murch, one of the new editors, told CoinDesk in an email.The nomination process, which kicked off in January after a recommendation by AJ Towns, and by Bitcoin’s standards could be said to have gone rather smoothly. For a while, it was unclear exactly how many new editors to add.“I thought it could have gone faster,” Chow said. “If you look at the thread, it kind of went silent for a few weeks — that was frustrating.”Good timingAt least in the world of blockchain — where “move fast, break things” and “test in production” are common mantras — Bitcoin development could be seen as comparatively slow. For instance, the last major protocol-wide upgrade, Taproot, went live three years ago, after years of R&D.To some extent, this has all changed since the introduction of Casey Rodamor’s Ordinals protocol last year, which ignited a new meme-loving trading culture on a chain that has for years tried to resist the more “degenerate” aspects of the wider crypto market. And so, there is a case to be made that the new BIP editors couldn’t have come at a better time.Though some used the moment of yesterday’s nomination as an opportunity to troll, tweeting that OP_CAT — a novel way to introduce smart contracts on Bitcoin to build more complicated apps — was assigned a BIP number 420. References to cannabis culture aside, the joke does help elucidate the tensions and human conflicts inherent in essentially gatekeeping what proposals count.Dashjr, for instance, is a known opponent of OP_CAT and Ordinals, and some saw him as unfairly standing in the way of approving their respective proposals.See also: The Blocksize Wars Revisited: How Bitcoin's Civil War Still Impacts Bitcoin “As far as I am aware OP_CAT has not been assigned a BIP number,” BastionZero CTO Ethan Heilman, one of the proposal's co-authors, told CoinDesk in an email. “We could be assigned a BIP number at any point so this information may be out of date. The only source of truth on this question is the BIP PR here.”“I'm glad to see the Bitcoin community getting more editors. It is a good sign for Bitcoin development. Being a BIP editor is a thankless job and I appreciate the work that BIP editors put in to help the community. I am grateful to everyone that volunteered for this role,” Heilman added.Indeed, it’s possible that more editors means more BIPs get approved and merged — after all, the end game is efficiency. But it’s possible that Bitcoin, filled as it is with strong personalities who hold strong opinions, may always be more interested in debate than speed.Chow for one said that although she has a more “relaxed view” of what should be considered a BIP, she doesn’t think Ordinals (which she called “kinda dumb”) meet the criteria — though she wouldn’t oppose it out of hand.“It's just documentation,” Chow said. “Who cares?”Edited by Bradley Keoun."

But Standard Chartered is not bearish amid its changing view on prospects for an ether ETF. Digital assets have endured a perfect storm of negative headwinds in recent weeks, yet the worst is over and the market is well-positioned to recover, Standard Chartered said in a research report on Tuesday. \"Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows have stalled, and ether ETFs now look unlikely to be approved in May as expected,\" analyst Geoff Kendrick wrote. The analyst had previously said that ether spot ETFs would likely gain approval on May 23, according to a March 18 report.The \"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has targeted decentralized finance (DeFi) by suing Uniswap, U.S. Treasury yields have jumped, Federal Reserve rate cuts have been pushed back, and BTC and ETH – as risky assets – have been pulled lower by the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East,\" Kendrick said.Still, the bank says that the bad news is already priced in for bitcoin and ether, and \"positive structural drivers\" are expected to take over again. The company reiterated its end-of-year bitcoin price target of $150,000 and its ether forecast of $8,000. Bitcoin was trading around $66,800 and ether was near $3,237 at publication time. Market positioning is now much cleaner than before, as $261 million of leveraged long positions were removed from the bitcoin futures market on April 13 in response to Iran's attack on Israel, the report noted. This was the largest daily liquidation since October 2023. Bitcoin spot ETF inflows have likely slowed due to macro reasons, the report said. These include higher U.S. Treasury yields and geopolitical tension in the Middle East.Furthermore, the first wave of ETF buying may be largely complete, which means a strong positive driver of the market has stalled for now, the bank said. The next wave of buying will be the inclusion of these ETFs in wider macro funds, but this could take some time.Read more: Standard Chartered Raises Year-End BTC Forecast to $150K, Sees 2025 High of $250KEdited by Nick Baker."

At press time, bitcoin traded at $66,200, with the 200-day average at $47,909.That's noteworthy for traders as past data show the most intense phase of the bullish cycle unfolds after the average surpasses its previous peak to new lifetime highs.In early November 2020, six months after the third halving, bitcoin's 200-day SMA rose to its then-highest above $10,320. By mid-April 2021, bitcoin had rallied 4.5 times to $63,800.The 200-day SMA's move to new highs has historically paved the way for the most intense phases of bull markets. (CoinDesk/TradingView) (CoinDesk/TradingView)The cryptocurrency surged over 2000% to nearly $20,000 in 12 months after the average set new highs in December 2016, or five months after the second halving. A similar meteoric rally unfolded after the average rose to a new peak in November 2012, around the time of the first halving.As always, past data is no guarantee of future results.That said, some features of the past cycles have been repeated to a T. For instance, BTC's bear market climaxed in November 2022, and prices rose in subsequent months, which aligns with the historical pattern of bottoming out to start a new rally 15 months ahead of the halving. Bitcoin blockchain implemented the fourth mining reward halving on Saturday, reducing the per-block coin emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.Most analysts are of the view that rising government debt concerns will eventually force the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut interest rates rapidly, keeping risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, in an uptrend.In the short term, however, prices may drop due to profit-taking and volatility in bond markets.Edited by Sandali Handagama."

Per Bitfinex, the halving of rewards means the notional value of the total number of new coins added to the supply daily could drop to $30 million. That's a significant decrease, equating to five times less than the average daily demand for the U.S. spot ETFs.\"With the daily issuance rate declining post-halving, we estimate that the new supply added to the market (new BTC mined) would amount to approximately $40-$50 million in USD-notional terms based on issuance trends. It is expected that this could possibly drop over time to $30 million per day, including active and dormant supply as well as miner selling, especially as smaller miner operations are forced to shut down shop,\" analysts at Bitfinex said in a report shared with CoinDesk.\"The average daily net inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs dwarf that number at over $150 million, even though flows have moderated and even turned net negative over recent weeks,\" analysts added.The supply squeeze has already begun. Since halving, the total number of new coins added to the supply daily has dropped to 450 BTC (nearly $30 million) from the pre-halving four-year average of around 900 BTC, data from Glassnode show.The daily coin issuance has slowed after halving. (Glassnode) (Glassnode)Nearly a dozen spot-based ETFs began trading in the U.S. on Jan. 11, allowing investors to take exposure to cryptocurrency without owning it. Bitfinex is assuming that the average daily inflows into ETFs since inception will remain constant in the coming months.While it remains to be seen if they do, miner selling could slow. Miners or entities responsible for minting coins ran down their coin inventory in months leading up to the halving to fund equipment upgrades to ensure post-halving sustainability of operations. Data tracked by Glassnode show that in six months leading up to the halving, the number of coins held in wallets tied to miners fell by over 18,000 BTC to 1.82 million BTC.Lastly, according to Bitfinex, investors are again increasingly taking direct custody of their coins, weakening the market's supply side.\"Current on-chain data indicates that Bitcoin exchange outflows are reaching peaks not seen since January 2023, suggesting that many investors are moving their holdings to cold storage in anticipation of price increases,\" analysts at Bitfinex said.\"Meanwhile, the active selling by long-term holders has not precipitated the typical pre-halving price drop yet, indicating a robust absorption of this selling pressure by new market entrants,\" analysts added.Bitcoin changed hands at $66,660 at press time, up over 5% since halving, defying expectations of a price correction.

The key reason would be miners offloading their BTC inventory worth $5 billion to keep their operations steady after having their revenue cut, he explained.On the longer outlook, though, the past three halvings were followed by an exponential move higher for bitcoin's price about 50-100 days after the event, crypto hedge fund QCP Capital pointed out in a Monday market update. \"If this pattern is repeated this time, BTC bulls still have a few weeks to build a larger long position,\" the report said.The fund also noted that funding rates – the cost leveraged derivatives traders need to pay for keeping their positions open – cooled off from very hot levels, and even turned into deep negative territory for some smaller cryptocurrencies, making them ripe for a swift move higher if risk-appetite returns.Funding rates have cooled substantially compared to last month (CoinGlass)\"What we could see in the short-term is a short-squeeze led by altcoins and memecoins which have seen persistent negative funding, with some as deep as -100% [annualized],\" QCP Capital said. \"Improving speculative sentiment could see short covering and a resumption of leveraged longs.\"Edited by Kevin Reynolds."

        "content": "After years of R&D, the Stacks blockchain is getting an overhaul. The rollout of the popular Bitcoin scaling layer’s largest upgrade to date began at Bitcoin block height 840,360 (around 14:30 UTC), beginning a two-step process that will end sometime in late May.Called Nakamoto, honoring Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, the upgrade will decouple the Stacks block production schedule from Bitcoin's. Although the layer-2 network has a higher transaction throughput than Bitcoin (which processes about 7 transactions per second), as initially designed, Stacks produced blocks at the same rate as Bitcoin, leading to congestion issues, network creator Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk.Nakamoto will introduce a new way of producing Stacks blocks, updating its bespoke proof-of-transfer consensus algorithm. Starting today, new block “signers” will start coming online to validate “tenures” of transactions. At first, until the upgrade is fully activated in May, this will all be for “'practice,” Stacks developers said on X. (If you want to learn more about what’s changing on a technical level, read here.)For casual users of Stacks, the developers recommend checking you’re using an updated wallet, which in many cases should happen automatically. For those who stake their STX tokens, the instantiation on Monday automatically unlocked those tokens, which can then be restaked when Nakamoto-compliant pools come online, likely sometime next week.There is currently about $1.3 billion worth of STX staked on-chain, representing about one-third of the total $4.2 billion circulating supply, making it one the largest interest-earning pools of capital related to bitcoin. The token has rallied more than 16% to about $2.90 over the past 24 hours, pushing it for the first time into the top 25 tokens by market capitalization.See also: Bitcoin L2s Are Poised to Break Out, Stacks Creator Says"

        "content": "Welcome to “Epoch V” of Bitcoin. On April 20 Bitcoin underwent its fourth successful halving, the programmed slashing of the amount of new bitcoin (BTC) that enters into circulation via mining. While the event itself is a bit of a barnburner — a moment for people around the world to celebrate virtually and in person — many eyes are on what is to come.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteThe launch of Runes, a new protocol that enables the creation of meme coins on Bitcoin, coincided with the halving. Already hundreds of tokens have launched, contributing over $80 million in fees to bitcoin miners. This increased trading activity has also driven up the costs associated with sending a transaction on Bitcoin, with the current average price over $70, an increase of 1,395.8% over the trailing 30 day average, according to TokenTerminal.While it’s hard to say whether this activity will level out, there are some who think “Epoch V,” or the period of time leading up to the next halving in 2028, will be when Bitcoin layer 2s like the Lightning Network will finally catch on. On April 20, bitcoin fees hit an all-time high of $128.“Anything that causes fee rates to spike will probably drive people to seek out other solutions,” Bitcoin Core developer Ava Chow said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Lightning is one option. Also there are side chains like Fedimint, Ark and a bunch of layer 2s. High fee environments will prompt people to look into them.”See also: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Come Crashing Down Post HalvingIt’s a point echoed by a recent Messari report, which argued that with the rising level of on-chain activity, “layer-2 solutions for Bitcoin are not just a luxury but a necessity,” analyst Nikhil Chaturvedi wrote. Bitcoin is no longer just “digital gold,” but a platform on which to build.This shifting mindset was stirred by the launch of the Ordinals protocol last year, which enabled new ways of storing data on the smallest units of BTC, called satoshis. There have already been over $3 billion in NFT-like Ordinal “inscription” sales, and trading activity is trending up with the average number of transactions approaching 2 million.But Ordinals is hardly alone in driving up Bitcoin fees. BitVM, a way to move computation off-chain, enables people to build Ethereum-like smart contracts on Bitcoin. Babylon is building a way to stake and earn yield on BTC holdings. And layer 2s like Stacks and Merlin are becoming home to a number of decentralized apps and meme coins.Interestly, in the days since the halving, tokens associated with Bitcoin L2s have outperformed BTC. For instance, Elastos’ ELA token has risen 11%, and SatoshiVM’s SAVM climbed 5%. Stack’s STX token has gained nearly 20% to $2.87 — though that may also have been driven by the network’s anticipated Nakamoto upgrade, which began rolling out today.While market forces will likely drive action to Bitcoin’s secondary layers, that may not always be a good thing. For one thing, those with low bitcoin balances may be priced out from using platforms like Lightning, if they want to use it non-custodially and set up their own channels, Chow suggested.“The problem is, all of these layer 2s require an on-chain transaction,” Chow said, referring to something like the “inbound capacity” needed to fund a Lightning account. Lightning users also have to pay for an on-chain closing transaction. “In a high fee environment that means it's going to be a little bit hard to actually start using those things.”See also: OG Bitcoin L2 Stacks Is Getting a Major OverhaulOf course, there are workarounds to this: custodial Lightning companies that subsidize these surprisingly expensive transactions.“I am concerned higher BTC fees will drive users to custodial Lightning services … giving BTC users no sovereignty or anonymity over their BTC holdings,” pseudonymous bitcoiner and Lightning critic Sovereign Matt told CoinDesk. “Custodial Lightning services will become the new banks/middlemen that people will have to trust with their life savings as it will be too expensive to self-custody and transact using mainchain bitcoin.”To some extent, all of this is downstream of the so-called Blocksize Wars over how to scale Bitcoin years ago, where it was decided that instead of ramping up the size of Bitcoin blocks to scale the chain through layer 2s. That set Bitcoin down the path it’s currently on.“There's basically two schools of thought on increasing the number of transactions per block. You can make blocks bigger, or you can make transactions smaller,” Chow said, adding that expanding the block size is like “brute forcing” a solution.There are ways of making bitcoin transactions smaller, and more compact, but until that happens, it’s like layer 2s will grow.Edited by Bradley Keoun."

Still, crypto exchange Deribit's BTC DVOL index, an options-based measure of expected price volatility over the next 30 days, has decreased from 75% to 70% on an annualized basis. That's an extension of the pullback from March highs at around 80%, according to data from TradingView.In other words, despite the price drop, there has been little panic buying of put options or derivatives offering downside protection, which is usually the case in traditional markets. Implied volatility is influenced by demand for options.Meanwhile, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of expected price turbulence over four weeks, has significantly increased from an annualized 13% to 19%. The index is based on options tied to the S&P 500 index, which has experienced a 5.4% decline this month.The MOVE index, which measures expected volatility in U.S. Treasury notes, has increased from 94% to 111% alongside a decline in bond prices (and an uptick in yields).The diverging trend in the BTC DVOL does not necessarily mean bitcoin is seen as a relatively safe asset and is a bull market feature.

At the same time, TeraWulf (WULF) and Core Scientific (CORZ) have existing AI operations or plans to grow in the space.“This trend suggests that bitcoin mining may increasingly move to stranded energy sites while investment in AI grows at more stable locations, authors led by James Butterfill wrote.The miners will be faced with substantial cost increases as a result of the halving, with electricity and overall production costs almost doubling, the report said. Mining companies can try to mitigate these higher costs by optimizing energy costs, increasing mining efficiency and buying better-priced hardware.“The weighted average cash cost of production in Q4 was approximately $29,500; post-halving, it is projected to be about $53,000,” the authors wrote. The average electricity cost of production in the fourth quarter was about $16,300 per bitcoin, which is expected to increase to around $34,900 post the halving.The hashrate could rise to 700 exahash by 2025, according to the asset manager’s forecasts, but may drop by 10% after the halving as miners turn off unprofitable machines. Hash prices are expected to fall after the event to $53/ph/day.Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.CoinShares notes that the miners are actively managing financial liabilities, and some are using excess cash to pay down debt.Read more: Bitcoin Miners Are Better Positioned for the Halving This Time Round: BenchmarkEdited by Parikshit Mishra."

Bitcoin, meanwhile, has gained just over 4.7% to $66,300. STX is one of the best-performing top 25 cryptocurrencies of the past 24 hours, per Velo Data.Other layer 2 coins, like Elastos’ ELA token and SatoshiVM’s SAVM, have risen 11% and 5%, respectively, since halving.Bitcoin layer 2 solutions are projects that address scalability and transaction speed limitations on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and bring scalability by processing transactions off the main chain.While Ethereum layer 2 solutions mainly focus on scaling the Ethereum smart contract blockchain, Bitcoin Layer 2 projects aim to scale and introduce programmability features to the main blockchain, which doesn't operate an Ethereum-like virtual machine.The market-beating move of Bitcoin layer 2 coins comes amid the post-halving surge in transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain. Data tracked by Glassnode show the mean transaction fee soared to nearly 0.0020 BTC after halving, reaching the highest since early 2018.The spike in fees could be explained by the launch of a new protocol called Runes that allows users to “etch” and mint tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. Runes' debut saw speculators rush to mint tokens and trade meme coins, catalyzing increased transaction activity and higher transaction costs.According to data source Ord.io, the total number of Runes inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain was 3,700 at press time.Bitcoin: Mean transaction fees (BTC) (Glassnode)Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Shares of the BTC trust are to be issued and distributed automatically to holders of GBTC shares. (The pro forma financial statements are projections of future expenses and revenues, based on a company's past experience and future plans.)Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust was conceived to offer GBTC investors a lower fee option that’s more competitively in line with other bitcoin ETFs approved back in January. Currently, the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) at 0.19% is the lowest-cost spot bitcoin ETF.The Grayscale spinoff is also considered a non-taxable event for GBTC’s existing shareholders, so those investors will not be expected to pay capital-gains tax to automatically transfer into the new fund. Some early stage GBTC investors with gains in the thousands of percentages would face a significant taxable event to switch to a competitor product with a lower fee.Grayscale’s GBTC appeared over a decade ago, originally offered through a private placement. In mid-2015, the shares began trading publicly on an over-the-counter basis. This continued until January 2024 when GBTC uplisted to NYSE Arca as a spot bitcoin ETF, along with competition products from other companies including BlackRock and Fidelity.Grayscale’s current assets under management stands at around $19.6 billion; its nearest rival, which is BlackRock’s IBIT fund, has grown to just over $17.5 billion.CORRECTION (April 20, 2024, 20:44 UTC): Removes reference to the number of bitcoin that would be moved from GBTC to the new fund.Edited by Nikhilesh De."

        "content": "Despite this being the most anticipated Bitcoin halving yet (at least according to Google search history), it was the launch of the high-profile Bitcoin builder Casey Rodamor’s latest creation – Runes – that turned heads, even among long-time blockchain developers who despise the digital tokens that can be minted on the platform.Rodamor is known for the release of Ordinals, a protocol that allows people to “inscribe” data on the smallest units of bitcoin (i.e. satoshis) to create highly valued assets on Bitcoin. Ordinals is largely credited for inspiring a renewed developer ecosystem on Bitcoin.Runes is similar to Ordinals, in that it allows people to “etch” and mint tokens on-chain – the main difference is that ordinals are “non-fungible” (i.e. one-of-a-kind) while Runes will function more like meme coins, which have recently taken crypto markets by storm.The first Runes project to mint was Rodamor’s own UNCOMMON•GOODS project, which was announced well in advance of the halving, as were many of the projects looking to etch themselves on these highly coveted satoshis.See also: The Bitcoin Halving Is Here, and With It a Giant Surge in Transaction FeesImpossible to know in advance, however, is what other projects would be able to find space on these scarce satoshis. There are already quite literally hundreds of Runes projects that are currently being minted and looking for prospective buyers.About nine blocks after the halving, Runes minters had already paid 78.6 BTC in fees (~$4.95 million) in order to buy the rarest of the rare. This suggests that, like Ordinals, the Runes protocol could be a boon to Bitcoin’s burgeoning fee economy.What makes a Runes project potentially viable is something of a subjective measure: being an early project to list — like DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, which has the honor of being “Rune Number 3” — is one measure. But buyers are also judging projects based on the “quality” of its ticker.A number of Runes projects were already starting to mint before the halving happened, including DOG•DOG•DOG•DOG•DOG, MEME•ECONOMICS, SHORT•THE•WORLD and PEPE•WIT•HONKERS, including dozens others, according to runebtc.xyz.Prior to the halving block being mined, prospective buyers in an X Space hosted by Leonidas, a well-regarded Ordinals collector, users and speculators alike were discussing which Runes to mint and trading ticker names.Among the names dropped were Taproot Wizards, the Ordinals project co-created by Bitcoin OG influencers Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, and a project called Satoshi Nakamoto, named after Bitcoin’s creator, which at press time had over 5,000 holders who minted about 19,000 tokens.Which projects will actually prove to have long term value is hard to judge.“Yeah, I don't see any good memes, like, I mean, I'm just trying to figure it out,” one trader said. “To be quite frank, I haven’t minted anything yet.”See also: Runes DEX Secures $2 Million in Seed Investment to Pioneer AMM on Bitcoin“I’m trying to understand the space in general right now,” someone else responded. “These projects are like early Runes. Do you guys think that these are actually going to be the most valuable ones?”“I think it depends what happens with them,” someone responded.Another aspect to consider: how many of the tokens were “pre-mined,” or held in reserve for project creators to potentially release on the market later. Prior to the halving, Leonidas shared guidelines that suggested projects that pre-mine more than 10% of the token supply were “greedy.”“I think the pre-mines are going to be the ones that win,” one trader said. “Because like, it's so hard to come up with a good meme with a 13 character limit,” he said, referring to the hardcoded naming system Rodamor added to Runes to try to prevent “ticker squatters.”In time, Runes tickers will be able to list with shorter names. Within three years, there could be Runes projects with three-letter tickers, for instance.Though it’s unclear how well this strategy will play out. According to data source Ordiscan, one forethinking developer has already blocked off a series of tickers, including ZZZZ (which will be the “first four letter Rune” to mint in two years), ZZ and Z (the first two letter and one letter Runes to mint in three years) and A (the last single character Rune to mint in four years).In other words, with something so new, it’s hard to determine what to value.“As everybody is scrambling to figure out what the hell's going on, I want to just take a moment to say it's awesome being here with all of you,” Leonidas told his audience. “This is essentially the start of a new protocol that kicked off about 30 minutes ago. So let's see what happens. I think it's going to be very chaotic.”Edited by Bradley Keoun."

Bitcoin had slumped as low as $59,685 on Friday before rebounding above $65,000.Read more: The Bitcoin Halving Is Here, and With It a Giant Surge in Transaction FeesThe halving has historically been a precursor to a rally in the price of bitcoin, with the last one, in May 2020, giving way to a run up from $9,500 to $65,000 during the subsequent year.But this time, bitcoin has already embarked on a momentous rally to record highs, rising from $15,500 in late 2022 to $73,680, helped by optimism around the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and then then the ensuing enthusiasm after they began trading in January.On Thursday, JPMorgan said that it expected bitcoin to drop following the halving as it remained in \"overbought conditions\" based on the high level of open interest in bitcoin futures.

But crypto miners had been competing actively for the block since it contains the first \"sat\" – the smallest denomination of bitcoin – following the halving. These \"epic sats\" that follow halvings are seen as collector's items, and some mining executives have suggested that this individual fragment of a bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars, or many multiples of the current price of an entire bitcoin.Screenshot from Mempool.space showing block No. 840,000, when the halving occurred (Mempool.space)The Runes protocol for fungible tokens, from Casey Rodarmor, the developer behind the Ordinals platform that launched last year to enable NFTs on Bitcoin, also launched at block 840,000. Less than an hour after the launch, 853 of the runes had already been etched, according to the website runealpha.xyz.A quick glance at the fees paid by users to get transactions included in blocks might reflect the intense competition by users to mint the new runes: the $2.4 million fees for the halving block compared with $40,000 to $60,000 for a more typical block before the halving. Several of the ensuing blocks also came with more than $1 million of fees.\"We've not had anything like this in the history of Bitcoin,\" the prominent Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song said during a livestreamed watch party hosted by Tone Vays. \"We're stressing the network in a different way, in ways we've never stressed it before.\"Chart from Mempool.space shows the massive spike in transaction fees (Mempool.space)On-chain data shows that the median satoshis per byte (sats/vByte) fee has exploded post-halving to 1,805 sats/vByte. Pre-halving on April 19, this most recent median fee was closer to 100 sats/vByte.(Sats/vbyte (satoshis per byte) is a measurement of the fee rate used to conduct a Bitcoin transaction, indicating how many satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) you are willing to pay for each byte of data in your transaction.)In layman's terms, this means that transaction fees have surged, with medium-priority transactions costing $146 and high-priority transactions costing around $170.Miners are expected to rely more on higher transaction fees and a potential increase in bitcoin's price to offset the expected decline in revenue due to the reduced mining subsidy, especially in the short term.Transaction fee rates on Bitcoin were elevated after the halving (Mempool.space)For CoinDesk's complete coverage, please see our Bitcoin Halving landing page.The mining reward – which dropped to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC during this halving – is an incentive for entities who contribute computing power to secure Bitcoin. The miner that wins the race to add each new block to the network takes away the mining reward, the amount of which is fixed until it's cut again at the next halving, as programmed by the cryptocurrency's elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Soaring fees, though, in the aftermath of the halving suggest miners could have a lucrative new revenue stream in the Runes era – though several people speaking on the Tone Vays livestream expressed the belief that the fee spike will end up being temporary.The quadrennial halving is seen as a momentous occasion in the crypto community because it symbolizes Bitcoin's original concept as an autonomous, decentralized financial network whose monetary policy is set by code, as opposed to human organizations like governments and central bankers.Unlike traditional, or fiat, currencies, whose value has historically been eroded by inflation and government printing, bitcoin is designed to be non-inflationary with a maximum total supply of 21 million BTC in circulation. With the halvings every four years, the pace of new issuance of bitcoins reduces over time until the last one is mined, likely sometime in 2140.Read More: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedHistorically, halvings have been followed by surges in bitcoin's price. The thinking is that the fewer new BTC are being produced, the more valuable those already in existence become. This time, the outlook is murky. Some market commentators say the halving is already priced into BTC and, therefore, the immediate effects may be muted. Others see the bitcoin price falling, while yet others have suggested a rally is in store.The potential effects of this present halving may be impossible to predict due to the profound differences in the Bitcoin landscape compared with the three previous events. Notably, January's long-awaited approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. means greater institutional investment is coming to BTC by orders of magnitude.Also, following the launch of the Ordinals protocol early last year, there is now much greater activity going on under the hood of Bitcoin, with developments and upgrades to the network potentially bringing far more utility to the notoriously conservative ecosystem.Edited by Sheldon Reback, Bradley Keoun and Nick Baker."

Hal Finney died in 2014 due to complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.HRF Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein said the award is meant to honor those who make vital contributions to Bitcoin.“Obviously we can't give it to Satoshi. So, beyond that, it's Hal. No one even comes close to his contributions,” Gladstein told CoinDesk in an interview. “He coded until his last days. I mean, he literally contributed to human freedom until his muscles didn't cooperate anymore.”Read more: Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?“Hal would have been thrilled to see how this Bitcoin ecosystem has grown, and to learn that this once-obscure software project is now used by tens of millions of people worldwide,” Fran Finney said in a pre-recorded acceptance speech. “He would be honored to be the first recipient of this award, and humbled to have it be in his name. I feel great privilege and responsibility in accepting the first prize on his behalf.”The Human Rights Foundation has set aside an additional 32 bitcoin, worth over $2 million at current prices, out of its own treasury to make awards well into the future. “Our view is that in 40 years, it'll probably be the world's largest cash prize,” Gladstein said.For the next three years, the foundation will name a new laureate on Jan. 10, also known as “Running Bitcoin Day,” or the day Hal Finney posted on Twitter (now X) about becoming the first person besides Satoshi Nakamoto to download the Bitcoin software. After that, the awards will be handed out to coincide with Bitcoin halvings, approximately every four years. (The next one happens in a few hours from press time.)Read more: This Bitcoin Halving Is Different. But Is It 'Priced In'?The first four awards, including Finney’s, are meant specifically to retroactively reward those who made the biggest contributions to Bitcoin within the periods between each of the first four halvings: 2009-2012 (Finney), 2012-2016, 2016-2020 and 2020-2024. After that, the prize will go to those who contribute most in the intervening four years.A “Genesis Committee” of seven individuals – including “The Genesis Book” author Aaron van Wirdum, Africa Bitcoin Conference founder Farida Nabourema, Bitcoin Core dev Gloria Zhao, bitcoin++ and Base58 co-founder Lisa Neigut, Fedi founder Obi Nwosu, Stone Ridge Holdings CEO Ross Stevens and Running Bitcoin Challenge co-founder Vitus Zeller – was picked to lead the nomination process until 2028.Committee members will then nominate their successor, who will serve a four-year term.“This is a prize that will outlast us all,” Gladstein said, noting that the last Bitcoin halving will take place sometime in the next century. “Hopefully we can have some kind of intellectual lineage here going through the decades. The first seven are only going to choose somebody who they really feel embodies their ideals so hopefully you get a committee in 100 years that's somewhat reflective of the initial committee.”Who is Hal Finney?Even if Hal Finney had never discovered Bitcoin on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, becoming the first person to receive a bitcoin transaction and contribute code to the project, it’s likely he would be remembered by the Bitcoin community for his many contributions to cryptography and his privacy advocacyA graduate of the California Institute of Technology, Finney began to make contributions to foundational cryptographic communications tool Pretty Good Privacy (better known as PGP) in the early 1990s, before working for the PGP Corp. directly until retirement. The program remains one of the best ways to encrypt online communications.“The work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete,” he wrote to a group of cryptographers, at a time when the U.S. government was looking to limit the public’s access to strong encryption.Finney’s work on PGP led to his interest in digital currencies, which he thought could better protect people’s privacy than the emerging payment options like credit cards that were beginning to dominate (and still dominate) the web. In 2004, Finney created a prototype digital asset that reusable proof-of-work system, which although it didn’t catch on, went on to directly inspire Bitcoin.See also: Bitcoin and the Rise of the CypherpunksFour years later, when Satoshi unveiled the Bitcoin white paper, Finney was one of a few people who took notice. He responded on Satoshi’s announcement post on the cryptography mailing list that he looked forward to seeing how the concept would be developed and was offered early access to the project source code.Between 2009 and 2013, when Finney announced he was paralyzed on the BitcoinTalk forum, he made several key contributions to the Bitcoin software. Throughout his life he was a frequent marathon runner, alongside his wife Fran. In a 2009 Less Wrong blog post, Finney wrote “my dream is to contribute to open source software projects even from within an immobile body.”There are some who believe that Finney is Satoshi, or a possible contributor to a group that referred to itself under the collective name. A recent post by Bitcoin OG Jameson Lopp disputes this claim, after reviewing timestamps that show Finney was often probably elsewhere while Satoshi was online. Finney himself denied that he was Satoshi Nakamoto.“We wanted to do the prize not just to honor Hal’s contributions to Bitcoin, but digital privacy and freedom generally,” Gladstein said. “It is something that is very important to us.”Edited by Nick Baker."

        "content": "In 2023, we said goodbye to Crypto Winter. Now, it’s time to say hello to a new era of DeFi Summer, this time centering on the most buzzworthy yet also durable trends: Bitcoin. With Ordinals proving demand, exchange-traded fundes (ETFs) providing access and Bitcoin scaling solutions emerging, 2024 is set to unlock the ~$1 trillion asset class in ways previously unseen.This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.The initial decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution in 2020 centered around smart contracts unleashing blockchain utility beyond the simple maintenance of a ledger and asset. It transformed the technology into a platform for vast, interoperable financial ecosystems. On the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), people worldwide could essentially become their own banks, accessing hundreds of interoperable financial applications. This evolution offered a promising look into a future of finance governed by immutable code rather than fickle human beings.As DeFi Summer unfolded, the technology and enthusiasm fueling DeFi extended to non-financial blockchain applications, notably non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Blockchains demonstrated their versatility by hosting not only financial systems but also becoming hubs for art, culture and gaming. Spurred by the constant inquiry of \"what's next,\" blockchain technology seemingly expanded into every conceivable use-case, often stretching beyond its core utility and practicality at the height of the craze.Ultimately, the initial buzz about NFTs and blockchain's expansion turned to fear during the 2022 crypto winter, although this wouldn’t be the end for NFTs. 2023 witnessed a revival in the blockchain enthusiasm, thanks in part to NFTs making a strong comeback, this time taking the form of Ordinals on Bitcoin. Similar to how DeFi Summer revealed new blockchain capabilities, Ordinals and BRC20 tokens showcased Bitcoin's potential, sparking excitement about the future possibilities of blockchain technology.See also: With COMP Below $100, a Look Back at the 'DeFi Summer' The question arose: If Bitcoin could support NFTs and tokens, what other applications could its unparalleled security and popularity cover?Unlocking BTCFiIn retrospect, the NFT craze of 2021 can be interpreted as the fading-out of a hype cycle. While valuable, the technology was more a reverberation from DeFi’s big technological splash. In contrast, the current enthusiasm around Ordinals feels like the fading-in of a new cycle, representing newly discovered demand that will undoubtedly have downstream effects. This isn't merely a repetition of past utility; it's an intriguing development whose potential is just beginning to unfold.Prior to the advent of Ordinals and BRC-20, there was a widespread belief that Bitcoin served a solely passive role within the blockchain ecosystem, offering little beyond basic asset functionality. This perception has shifted dramatically. Thanks to a number of significant advancements from a usability standpoint, Bitcoin is emerging as a critical security-provider for DeFi and as an asset with newfound utility and interoperability.The future of Bitcoin DeFi involves bringing the Bitcoin network's security to EVM-compatible smart contracts. Leading EVM-compatible Bitcoin scaling solutions are innovating methods to incentivize bitcoin miners to secure both the BTC asset and smart contracts simultaneously but independently. Ensuring miners, and consequently bitcoin itself, gain value is essential for expanding the Bitcoin network beyond safeguarding just the BTC asset.Unlocking the BTC assetHistorically, BTC has served mainly as a passive store of value, not actively involved in DeFi security or commerce. Yet, much like ETH's dual role in securing Ethereum and serving as currency, bitcoin has the potential to evolve into a versatile asset beyond the base Bitcoin chain. The introduction of Bitcoin staking in 2024 is set to transform BTC from a passive to a rewards-generating asset, marking a significant shift in its utility.See also: DeFi Has a Risk Problem and It's Time to Solve ItOnce DeFi ecosystems become massively aligned with both bitcoin miners and bitcoin holders/stakers, those ecosystems become the greatest and safest platforms for \"BTCFi.\" As advancements such as HTLC atomic swaps and innovative bridging solutions overcome technical hurdles, BTC is set to pour into DeFi protocols. This influx will unlock extraordinary utility for the world's premier and most trusted blockchain-based asset.Building bitcoin DeFi togetherBitcoin is leading the creative front of blockchain innovation for the first time in years. Now that the Bitcoin base layer is widely recognized as permanently secure, it’s time to build solutions to bring it to new heights. Given that the BTC asset is the definitive self-sovereign asset, it only makes sense that the Bitcoin network should be the core protector of the future of self-sovereign decentralized finance.We, the Bitcoin community, are acutely aware of the vast potential lying dormant within our network and its currency. It's time to step forward and unlock this potential, fostering innovations that empower Bitcoin, DeFi and the pursuit of financial independence worldwide.Edited by Daniel Kuhn."

According to Google Trends data, which uses a 100 point scale to determine the relative popularity of keyphrases, there is more interest than ever in the Bitcoin network halving.This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.Interest in the term has steadily ramped up since the start of 2024, alongside search interest in the phrase “Bitcoin” (which is still below its 2017 peak in terms of search interest). The surge in interest this month is notable considering bitcoin’s (BTC) recent rally has stalled out, including turbulence this week, which saw it drop from a high around $70,000 last Friday to $63,000 today.(Google Trends)See also: This Bitcoin Halving Is Different. But Is It 'Priced In'?Less than 60 blocks away, the fourth Bitcoin halving will see the number of bitcoin paid out as a block reward to miners cut in half from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This particular halving is notable for a number of reasons, including the resurging interest in Bitcoin as a developer ecosystem, the onshoring of the U.S. mining industry following China’s ban and the relatively recent launch of spot bitcoin ETFs that helped ignite a (now ebbing) market rally.“This is the first halving in which major U.S. asset managers are educating on Bitcoin, and there’s no better Bitcoin education than learning about the halving. It’s a narrative event first – a quadrennial market moment – and a supply event second, though I think both aspects will be impactful,” Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn told CoinDesk via email.(Google Trends)Though it's not just fund managers having fun. As Decrypt initially reported, search frequency for “Bitcoin halving” surpassed the cannabis culture meme number “420” for the first time in its history. This is especially notable because the halving was initially scheduled to coincide with the April 20 holiday known for its cannabis-oriented celebrations, though is now likely to occur Friday evening.See also: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin HalvingEdited by Bradley Keoun."

Gox to purchase my first bitcoins (BTC). A few months later I relied on those coins to survive getting robbed of all my items and cash in capital controlled Argentina. LocalBitcoins was my realization of the reality of Bitcoin as world-changing technology, and my survival tool in an emergency.Then after getting into arbitrage trading and dipping into the bull market of 2013, I found work with the Mastercoin Foundation, funded by the first initial coin offering (ICO). In March 2014 I saw the debate over reactivating OP_Return as a soft-fork, but with a lower, 40 byte limit — the argument was that a higher threshold would enable spam.I saw the vehement passion by which the byte-size conservatives argued, and found it perplexing. Little did I know that this debate over whether the limit should be 40 bytes versus 80 bytes would continue to snowball into a whole ideological sectarian rift in the Bitcoin community.When I got into crypto, it was all about, you know, being able to control your own money, whether that means surviving being robbed of all your cash in a country with capital controls, buying LSD from a foreign chemist or any number of things synonymous with righteous resistance against tyranny and fostering human freedom and thriving.See also: Designer Drug Markets Get Boost From CryptoBut what resulted in the intervening years has been infighting. In short, the Bitcoin community, since the so-called “Blocksize Wars,” has seen fierce opposition between the pro-data people and the people who want Bitcoin to be a data-light form of digital gold.See also: What Is Bitcoin Meant to Hedge?Meanwhile, I dreamed a dream of decentralized derivatives backing synthetic dollars without any banking, earning yield off of basis trades when bitcoin price trends lead to futures contango (when longer-dated futures have a higher premium so there’s time value in being long bitcoin and short futures).To quote a famous man:WhatHere’s what happened:A number of U.S., citizens who transacted sums as small as $1,500 on LocalBitcoins were arrested, serving jail sentences for peer to peer tradingLocalBitcoins and many similar platforms were shut downBlackRock made us an offer we couldn’t refuse: Finally putting BTC as a ticker mainstream American baby boomers can purchase with their IRA accounts, causing our USD-denominated wealth to go upU.S. resident participation in most crypto activities became so problematic through tax enforcement complications, know-your-customer headaches and increasingly draconian penalties (such as the i6050 $10,000 threshold penalty for sending someone BTC or any other coin), meaning U.S. bitcoiners became predominantly focused on holding and not using BTCStablecoins emerged as the de facto blockchain-based way to transfer value (which started on the Mastercoin protocol, but due to the fees, quickly migrated to Ethereum). USDT on Tron is the category winner.The U.S. Foreign Accounts Tax Control Act or the OECD’s Common Reporting Standards laid a brush fire to the wildcat offshore banking of the 1990s and early 2000s, leaving us with a world closer to global financial governance.The Lightning Network, an attempt to create a flexible, low-cost way to spend BTC, found itself constrained with the irreducible on-chain cost of opening new channels, which limited any routing abstractions to try and fix the problem.The first major upgrade of Bitcoin network that was acceptable to political consensus since the 2017 Segwit upgrade, Taproot, got used as a work-around for the 80 byte OP_Return limit, leading to a renewed burst of NFT-trading activity around Bitcoin, driving up transaction fees. (This has rankled conservative bitcoiners who now want to avert any future upgrade for fear of similar ingenuity.)Jeremy Rubin, a prominent Bitcoin developer with an alternative way to scale the network, has become the subject of insults and scrutiny as possible agent provocateur for the supposed crime of making a moderately conservative upgrade meant to make Bitcoin more usable, mostly at his own expense as well as the expense of years of free labor for the team.BitVM by Robin Linus is the new Lightning; it’s like making a virtual machine out of switches in Minecraft, facilitating peg-in-peg-out without upgrading the core protocol. Jeremy Rubin has volunteered efforts on it such as flattening arrays. There is much debate about its limitations despite these herculean R&D efforts to make a path around the Holy Mountain of an ossified protocol (instead of drilling a tunnel through with a hard fork upgrade).In other words, in the past 15 years that Bitcoin has been around, a number of attempts designed to make the first and most important blockchain a suitable platform to develop on have failed or been resisted by the community. Did the “number go up”? Yes, yes it did. But is Bitcoin any better off? It’s hard to say.The time has come to honestly ask: did we fail?The Bitcoin community is not significantly closer to having a peer-to-peer medium of exchange reality where access to global liquidity and freedom of commercial association is a universally ensconced human right. And our *enemies*, people who hate human freedom, are actually closer to attaining the Carrol Quigley dream of a global college of ordoliberal consensus (i.e. a New World Orderrrr).We’re still busy arguing about ways to accomplish things that really could be done very easily with a single fork, but the issue is political and a preponderance of precautionary principle precipitating our placid perversions.Let me put it another way: it’s super weird when an engineering culture of crypto-anarchists develops anti-intellectualism.Having said that, I’ve been humbled by my own business trip-ups trying to make a work-around to Bitcoin’s inbuilt limitations. After years of experimenting on Bitcoin and having to rewrite my core software due to an avalanche of tech debt trying to cross-compile with the whole Bitcoin C++ project, and many years of boom and bust, I’m finally shipping. And I’m shipping on Litecoin first. Because, hey, Litecoiners are nice people. They, like me, have been humbled by pain.See also: Tether Stops Support for Bitcoin Layer OmniBeing humbled by pain did another things to me. It forced me to start practicing gratitude and that led me back to God, first in a reconstructionist sort of heretical Catholicism or revisionist protestant Christianity, and then to a reconstructionist, Quran-centric Sufi Islam. And one thing I learned from studying religion the last two years (building in the bear market, you might say) is that human beings love to be sectarian. We love it! It’s like, our favorite thing.Asserting one’s moral superiority over people who are otherwise your ideological brothers based on invented distinctions is one of the “finer things” in life. Repudiating human-made distinctions that distract from the purity of God’s principles is a major theme in the Qur’an (6:159, 30:32,42:14) and Gospels (Mark 7:5-8, Luke 9:46-56). It’s clear that us bitcoiners have fallen into the same tendency, because to err is human, but to forgive is divine mah Brothers!What’s happening in the state of the Bitcoin Ummah in this, the year of our Lord 2024, the month of April, the 4th halving, is we’re starting to appreciate that we’re too successful to fully succeed at sabotaging ourselves with endless sectarianism. The outspoken voices of a purist minority are being eclipsed by the onslaught of new users and capital inflow, and the unrelenting march of innovation by a few brilliant weirdos who are doing things with zero-knowledge proofs, embedding DeFi with work-arounds, and other hacks, to force Bitcoin to work as a medium of exchange that non-hodlers can utilize.The time where social media rhetoric dominated Bitcoin discourse is over, the time where usage demonstrates the trade-offs of competing technical solutions has dawned."

Bank of America recently pushed out the timing of the first Fed rate cut to December from June, while Societe Generale said the central bank would not cut rates until 2025.No urgency to cut ratesA few weeks ago, markets and policymakers were convinced that inflation would continue to cool in the coming months, allowing the Fed to cut rates rapidly in the year’s second half.However, the latest data, particularly March’s strong jobs report and hotter-than-expected inflation print, which showed a third straight monthly acceleration in the cost of living, has weakened the case for immediate rate cuts.“We know that there is no traditional justification for U.S. rate cuts in the short term. Employment is strong, retail sales are beating expectations, Q1 GDP is expected to be not much lower than Q4, and inflation is proving stubborn.

        "content": "This year’s halving — the quadrennial slashing of the amount of new bitcoin (BTC) entering into circulation — may be the most important since the first one around 12 years ago. And yet, despite intense interest in the event, its price impact may be more muted this year than previous halvings. Recently launched protocols, like Ordinals, and an increasingly robust mining sector, mean the effect could be relatively soft.This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.The Bitcoin halving, expected to take place late Friday night or early Saturday (April 20), comes with heightened expectations. In each previous case so far, the halving preceded massive sector-wide rallies. There is an ongoing debate whether the halving is “priced in,” or whether the reduced amount of bitcoin entering into circulation (this time dropping from around 900 BTC per day to 450 BTC) will create a kind of supply shock that will drive prices up (assuming demand for bitcoin remains constant or increases).There are two economic theories that explain this debate. On one side are those who believe the halving is priced in believe the efficient market theory. They say because the event is known in advance, and everyone shares the same information, it is impossible that bitcoin is currently undervalued. On the other side are those who point to the historic four-year boom and bust cycle in crypto and/or the aforementioned supply-and-demand constraints.See also: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin HalvingWhatever theory you believe, it’s worth noting that this Bitcoin halving is already markedly different. For one, it’s the first time in Bitcoin history that bitcoin’s price has increased before the event. That’s largely because of the launch of nearly a dozen spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., which have been vacuuming up bitcoin at unprecedented rates. BlackRock’s bitcoin fund, for instance, has the fifth-fastest inflows of any ETF so far this year.“There’s more work to do, but the industry has made significant progress in making bitcoin more accessible and easier to use since 2020,” Miles Suter, Bitcoin product lead at Cash App, told CoinDesk in an email. “While the recent rally has been led by institutional investors, with past halvings we’ve seen a positive sentiment shift in the market that attracts new retail traders; I think the cycle will repeat itself.”What’s different? The institutionsThe institutionalization of bitcoin has another element over and above changing the kinds of buyers of bitcoin (or the way they enter the market): It also serves to legitimize the sector. In previous years, the biggest-name buyers of bitcoin were Michael Saylor’s relatively unknown software company MicroStrategy, known bitcoin fan Jack Dorsey’s Block and Elon Musk’s Tesla, which partially walked back its commitment due to environmental concerns.ETFs changed that forever. This isn’t to suggest that Wall Street doesn’t have its detractors, but it is significant that firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, VanEck and WisdomTree were all clamoring to be first to market in offering a traditional onramp into this nascent digital economy. Bitcoin, once thought to be the Wild West, is becoming normalized — and no one is quite sure what is on the other side.See also: Bitcoin ETFs Are Driving a Spot Multiplier Effect“The people, institutions and governments that matter in the big picture are only *just beginning* to wake up to Bitcoin,” Lane Rettig, founder of SpaceMesh and former Ethereum developer, said. “Yes, this process takes a painfully long time, longer than we expect or would like - it's like a dragon slowly awakening, and right now it's just begun to stir.”It was a point echoed by Nelson Rosario of Rosario Tech Law, who views the halving as just the latest thing to drive attention to Bitcoin. “I think the questions I've seen around this halving somewhat miss the point. The fact is Bitcoin is at all-time high levels. It is a semi-regular news story in the financial press, and yet mass adoption still feels years away,” he said.Macroeconomic factorsIndeed, analysts at both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs this week published reports dampening the idea that the halving will bring in new buyers. A rallying market leading into the halving may be a way to generate buzz, but it may have also “pulled forward” a portion of “the typical post-halving rally,” JPMorgan analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.More importantly, macroeconomic conditions in 2024 are completely different than during the preceding decade of low interest rates and low inflation. Goldman's Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities as well as Equities teams wrote that the higher interest rates today may make high risk investments like crypto less attractive.It’s a point bolstered by BTC’s performance this week following news the Federal Reserve is reversing course from lowering interest rates, which would have brought liquidity into the economy. Price predictions from market analysts vary wildly, with some saying bitcoin could fall to as low as $40,000 post halving or rally above $150,000 by the end of the year.See also: Bitcoin Rebounds as $150K Target for 2024 Comes in ViewPseudonymous trader Poordart gave a “primitive calculation” adding to the idea that bitcoin could fall following the halving. “Assuming miners sell all mined bitcoin eventually, reducing the average daily number of bitcoin mined from 900 to 450 ($54 million to $27 million at current prices) should have some effect — $189m inflow per week less required just to keep price stable,” he told CoinDesk.Bitcoin’s 50% price gains this year seem to support the idea that people are willing to take risks — though that doesn’t mean traders shouldn’t proceed with caution. To some extent, the stakes of this halving are even more unclear than ever due to these institutionalization and macroeconomic trends, with some concerned that the halving distracts from the ultimate mission of Bitcoin.\"It is an odd thing to have to treat very, very human-made events as if they are acts of nature or God,” Nathan Schneider, professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder and author of “Governable Spaces: Democratic Design for Online Life.” “I long for the day when network-native economies are designed to serve human flourishing, not arbitrary parameters in code.\"Others, like Sarah Meyohas, creator of Bitchcoin and recent Satoshi Nakamoto inscription and hologram series, sees the halving as a symbol of Bitcoin’s resilience. “As we approach Bitcoin's halving, I am moved by the notion that a few people can shape the future of an entire generation through ideas alone.”How the halving will impact bitcoin minersA mix of factors — including halving the block reward, higher costs, cautious investors and an increasingly crowded mining sector — could be a harsh reality for bitcoin miners after the halving ramps up competition to find the next block.Historically, the halving has been a boon for the price of bitcoin, helping miners reap a fat profit margin. However, this time, it's different as publicly-traded and private bitcoin miners will have to work harder not just to mine the next block but also to convince investors and the markets to have faith in their ability to make money.Heading into this halving, miners are greeted with a cautious tone from investors. For instance, stocks from mining firms Marathon Digital, Hut 8 and Riot Platforms are down roughly 33%, 35% and 46%, respectively, this year. The risk associated with bitcoin mining is seen as greater than alternative mainstream ways to get exposure to crypto, including spot bitcoin ETFs, equities like Coinbase (COIN) and the broad based CoinDesk 20 index, which are less volatile.Read more: Bitcoin Soared to an All-Time High. So Why Aren't Miners Blasting Off, Too?To be able to survive and thrive after this halving, miners will need to be efficient, cash flow generating and have proper treasury management in place, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju wrote. He predicts that even if bitcoin remains at the $60,000 price level the current crop of mining machines would become unprofitable to run for many firms — leading to a wave of bankruptcies.Unless they are able to quickly deploy the latest generation of more efficient machines, Ju said that bitcoin’s price will need to rise to around $80,000 for miners to remain profitable using Bitmain's S19 XP mining machines, the most commonly utilized miners by U.S. companies.Miners have already started to replace their older-generation machines with newer ASICs. However, having the latest technology may not be enough to appease investors. Miners must prove they can make money by deploying capital efficiently, cutting costs, finding cheaper sources of power and generating positive cash flow for shareholders.Doom and gloom?For profitable firms, the post-halving landscape may become a season for mergers and acquisitions. Firms like Galaxy Digital, with its Helios mining farm, the largest liquid-cooled mine in the Northeast, are already buying up less efficient machines as the cheap cost of electricity in West Texas makes it profitable to run outdated chips.It’s not all doom and gloom. Increasingly, transaction fees are becoming a significant contributor to miners. Historically, miners earned lion's shares of profit from the block rewards. However, with the increasing ways to use the Bitcoin blockchain — most notably through the Ordinals protocol — miners are taking in more through increased fees.Another option, which some miners have already started to include in their business plan, is to diversify into other sources of revenue, such as repurposing existing data centers to host computing resources for artificial intelligence or cloud computing.Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is a ‘Show Me the Money’ Moment for MinersWhile others see the drop in revenues as potentially existential for miners, some experts think that the effects will be relatively muted compared to prior years. Some, like Colin Harper, researcher and writer for Luxor Technology’s Hashrate Index, thinks that this could be the first year that there is no dip in Bitcoin's hashrate, or the amount of energy contributed to network security, because prices have remained so high.\"Mining margins won't be as good after the halving as they are now, obviously, but they won't be horrendous,\" Colin Harper, researcher and writer for Luxor Technology’s Hashrate Index, told CoinDesk. \"And if the new Runes fungible token protocol makes a significant impact on transaction fees, then margins will be healthy enough to keep miners with higher costs online for longer than not.\"Launch of RunesAs mentioned, NFT-like inscriptions, made possible by the launch of the Ordinals protocol, have changed the game for Bitcoin. Not only has it shifted the economic landscape for miners, but it's also renewed developer excitement in the first cryptocurrency, which in recent years was losing out to chains like Ethereum and Solana.This halving will also see the launch of the Runes protocol, created by Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor. The system, which will allow tokens to be created, minted and transferred on Bitcoin, is set to launch immediately following the halving with the goal of introducing greater utility to Bitcoin — a mission which started with Rodarmor's prior creation, Ordinals.Rodarmor has described Runes as creating a venue for meme coins on Bitcoin, only with greater simplicity and efficiency than is currently provided by the BRC-20 token standard. Already, several Runes projects are being planned to coincide with the launch of the new protocol.Network securityAlthough, in prior years, halvings did not lead to an economic attack on Bitcoin (like a 51% attack), there are some concerns that lower profitability could lead to enough miners turning off that it becomes theoretically possible. For instance, Bitcoin's hash rate declined 15% after the 2020 halving, 5% after 2016's halving, and 13% after 2012, therefore making Bitcoin less secure.“The halving is one of the dumbest parts of how Bitcoin was designed. If you're going to reduce subsidy over time, the right way to do it is gradually, rather than shocking the system every four years,” legendary Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd told CoinDesk. “Fortunately fees are getting higher, so the risk of havings is reducing. Hopefully this one goes alright.”See also: How the Bitcoin Halving Could Affect Network SecurityRodarmor, and others, see Runes as important to the post-halving Bitcoin ecosystem in that it could bring out additional demand for block space — thereby bolstering the mining economy. Higher fees for validating transactions could however help to offset lower block reward revenue and keep the hash rate higher.\"I wouldn't advocate changing the halving schedule, but if I was going to design Bitcoin from scratch, I probably would not have picked such a fast decay,\" Rodarmor told CoinDesk. \"But you don't go to war with the army you want, you go to war with the army you have. And this is the Bitcoin we have.\"Ordinals was contentious among some corners of the Bitcoin community for causing network congestion and soaring user fees, something Runes would also probably face if it proves successful.\"I don't think that the best and highest use case for Bitcoin is Runes; I think that is bitcoin itself as a neutral, value delivery network,\" Rodarmor said. \"However, I do think that it is good to create sources of demand for Bitcoin transactions, because ultimately that helps the security of the network.\"If all goes well, it may not matter whether bitcoin is priced in.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."

        "content": "Bitcoin could drop to as low as $50,000 over the next few weeks as the macroeconomic uncertainty looms over the crypto market, said Markus Thielen, co-founder of 10x Research.Even the halving, which takes place on Saturday, might not drive the price of bitcoin up as most of the price action after previous cycles was driven by a better macro environment.Bearish signals are looming over the crypto market these days and will almost certainly push prices down in the short term, well-known research analyst Markus Thielen said.Thielen, who has previously predicted many bull and bear rallies in crypto, currently sees no catalysts that would bring prices up again, he said on CoinDesk’s Markets Daily podcast.“We don't have the typical drivers anymore that really brought prices from the $40,000 to the $70,000 region,” he said. The main reason behind this, he added, is the spot bitcoin ETFs, which have seen little to no new inflows over the past few weeks as investors have moved past the initial euphoria of the January launch.“It seems that a lot of the TradFi investors aren’t biting anymore,” Thielen said.Both the slowdown of flows into the ETFs and the recent sell off in crypto assets, however, are a result of a much bigger story, argued Thielen. It's the macro environment, he said, that has been and will continue to be the main driver behind prices.“I think a lot of the bitcoin rally is maybe built on wrong expectations and again,\" said Thielen. \"I think what's really, really crucial is that these ETF flows didn't stop out of the blue, they stopped around March 12 when the consumer price index and when the producer price index came out.”At the end of last year and into early 2024, traders were betting on multiple interest cuts by the Federal Reserve this year on expectations of a continued downtrend in inflation. That anticipation drove risk assets, such as tech stocks and cryptocurrencies, significantly higher.However, recent data, in particular the March inflation reports noted by Thielen, has shown that inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, leading the central bank to repeatedly voice uncertainty about whether it will indeed be able to lower interest rates this year.“We need to get the macro headwinds out of the way,” Thielen said. For now, he expects a consolidation period which could last for a few weeks and could push bitcoin down to around $50,000 before coming back up towards the end of the year.Bitcoin Halving Is Not BullishThielen also cautioned investors about the upcoming halving on April 20th, which many assume will be a wildly bullish event for bitcoin. This expectation stems from the token's previous post-halving cycles which typically saw bitcoin race to new all-time highs.Thielen, though, contended that those bull moves were largely a result of the positive macro environment, and not driven by the halving itself. The most recent halving in May 2020, for example, came alongside massive monetary and fiscal stimuli surrounding the Covid shutdowns.“I wouldn't give almost any credit to the halving because I don't think the halving is the big driver,” he said. “It's really the big macro factors.”Edited by Stephen Alpher."

The largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading below $61,400 during Asian hours on Thursday, according to CoinDesk Indices data, as the sell-off in risk assets, fueled by difficult macroeconomic conditions, raged. The CoinDesk 20, a measure of the world’s most liquid digital assets, fell 3.3% to 2,125. While bitcoin might be having a challenging moment, layer-1 blockchains and altcoins are doing worse.

Avalanche's (AVAX) has fallen 26%, Cardano's (ADA) 23% and Filecoin (FIL) 30%.Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange that was removed from India some months ago, is looking to re-enter the country by paying a $2 million fine, the Economic Times reported on Thursday. Earlier this year, Binance and some other exchanges were removed from the Apple Store in India after India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) sent them compliance \"show cause\" notices. OKX, KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global and Bitfinex were the other firms that were sent notices at the time.USDe holders should monitor the project’s reserve fund to avoid risks related to the potential of a negative funding rate, according to data provider CryptoQuant. Ethena Labs, the firm behind the stablecoin, currently offers an annual yield of 17.2%, a rolling average over the past seven days, to investors that stake USDe or other stablecoins on the platform. The yield is created from a tokenized “cash and carry” trade that involves purchasing an asset whilst simultaneously shorting that asset to rake in funding payments. Funding is a way of keeping the asset prices on derivatives exchanges close to the underlying assets. In a bullish market, holders of long positions pay short positions and the opposite is true in a bearish market.Chart of the DayPast bitcoin halvings have led to substantial price gains for bitcoin in the subsequent 12 months.The chart shows prices soared 1000%, after the first halving, 200% after the second and 600% following the third.Source: Glassnode- Lyllah LedesmaTrending PostsTether Reorganizes Into 4 Divisions as It Expands Beyond StablecoinsBinance Secures Full Virtual-Asset Services Provider License in DubaiBitcoin Likely to Drop After the Halving, JPMorgan SaysEdited by Sheldon Reback."

At press time, it was trading at $60,200.Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization, tumbled below $3,000 declining 2.5% over the same period.The weakness echoed through most crypto markets, with all CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) sectors being in the red, while the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index lost 1.8%.CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) sector performances (CoinDesk)The spot market order book for BTC-USDT on crypto exchange Binance, the most liquid trading pair, shows bids clustered below $60,000, outweighing sale orders.

        "content": "In the nether realms of crypto-Twitter/X, there is a brewing civil war between the “monetary maximalists” and “JPEG enjoyers.” While the Bitcoin network is limited in its storage capacity, the threshold for confirming transactions of any kind whether monetary or any arbitrary data from things like Ordinals inscriptions and meme coins is actually quite limited within each block.The mempool can become congested relatively quickly and drive up fees for all users.This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.Taras Kulyk is the founder and CEO of SunnySide Digital, Inc.UnmuteHerein lies the conflict: is Bitcoin open to anyone for any purpose? Or did Satoshi Nakamoto have an intended purpose for his creation, which should be accounted for when deciding who can use Bitcoin and how?It turns out there are heavy consequences and tradeoffs for both paths. As the saying goes, “Bitcoin is for enemies,” and we are finding out just how true that is. Here is why the Battle over Block Space is worth fighting, and why the question remains who will ultimately obtain the spoils of war.The monetary maximalist perspectiveTo begin, the title of the white paper is “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash system,” allowing for “online payments” to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. It makes no mention of file storage. On the surface, this might feel like enough precedent to legitimate monetary transactions only (some treat it as scripture). However, Satoshi himself made an inscription on the Genesis block with the famous headline from The Times in 2009 that read “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”The takeaway here is that invoking WWSD (What Would Satoshi Do?) or reapplying what he has done or said in the past via email is a losing battle. Putting aside some of the apparent contradictions between what Satoshi himself sometimes did and said, the core argument for Monetary Maximalism is that Ordinals inscriptions and BRC20 tokens spam the blockchain and abuse the current rule set. They could be considered a kind of DDOS attack. Or worse, a grift.See also: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the HalvingIn short, why focus on meaningless, fun-for-some pet JPEGS (often with VC ties) on Bitcoin when the real aim is revolutionizing global money, value storage and peer-to-peer payments. Using Bitcoin as file storage, which is predominately done in wealthy nations, is pricing those out in developing countries that rely on bitcoin for day-to-day transactions. It might even push out new entrants that notice how high fees are, forcing them to explore cheaper options as new users typically won't understand L2s like the Lightning Network — this might be their one shot at giving bitcoin a try.What’s more, given the block size limitations on the Bitcoin blockchain, data / file storage doesn’t scale on the protocol. The only way to scale file storage is to make the system more centralized (which is arguably why Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake) and that is obviously a fast track to obsoletion.I fundamentally believe what’s good for miners is good for Bitcoin.And yet, there are very real benefits in the near term for storing more data on-chain, like higher fees for miners, taking market share from other chains and encouraging expressivity and development, among other things.Ordinals: magically growing fees, usage and funInscriptions, whether you hate them or love them, have helped jumpstart a fee war, comprising 21% of all fees last year. While it’s true that inscriptions have helped ignite a competitive transaction fee environment (the peak of the inscription craze in May was $18 million), regular daily transaction fees have amounted to $13 million. Miners even saw fees double the block reward multiple times last year thanks to inscriptions. Ordinals are also responsible for the largest block and largest transaction in Bitcoin’s history. That’s no small feat, and as someone who’s deeply involved in the digital mining ecosystem, I fundamentally believe what’s good for miners is good for Bitcoin.A healthy and lucrative fee war, whether they are monetary transactions or ordinals, is unarguably positive for miner revenues in what is proving to be a cut-throat capitalistic industry.What’s more, the top two noncustodial bitcoin wallets (Unisat and xverse) by active users are both Ordinal/BRC20 wallets, with each growing over 30% month over month. What got us here might not be the same thing that is going to get us to where we need to go. In order to reach that level of adoption, the ideology in its current form will have to evolve. The goal is to be the predominant blockchain for everything that, at this point in time, is currently siloed on different protocols.The gravitational force of Bitcoin, by way of engaging fun, cultural and technological movements as found in ordinals, NFTs, etc., will also benefit everyone who owns and is passionate about Bitcoin.When it comes down to it, Bitcoin is about economic incentives only, not altruism. While it’s true the high fees will prevent others from transacting on-chain, it could be argued that this is exactly what it’s all about: free market forces.Hate it or ignore itThe fact of the matter is, if you’re a monetary maximalist you could probably get away with ignoring ordinals and be just fine. They’re accelerating Bitcoin adoption and a healthy fee market for blockspace in the near term, and long term are likely to be priced out entirely and pushed to other layer 2 or sidechain solutions.See also: OG Bitcoin L2 Stacks Is Getting a Major OverhaulNaturally, Bitcoin, as the monetary network we all believe it will be, will eventually price out all uneconomic transactions regardless.The network was built from a security model standpoint to bake in higher fees, so the argument that a spike in fees now is bad for Bitcoin later is nonsensical. My take: ignore the noise, let this trend play out, and of course — stay humble and stack sats.Edited by Daniel Kuhn."

Under their proposed bill, payment stablecoin issuers would have reserve and operational requirements, including needing to create subsidiaries specifically to issue stablecoins.

The quadrennial event will reduce BTC's per block emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, halving the pace of new supply. Previous halvings preceded massive multimonth rallies in BTC, and the crypto community is confident that history will repeat itself.Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, however, cautioned its clients from reading too much into the past halving cycles.\"Historically, the previous three halvings have been accompanied by BTC price appreciation after the halving, although the time it took to reach the all-time highs differs significantly.

(Goldman Sachs)The chart shows bitcoin's performance after previous halvings on Nov. 28, 2012, July 9, 2016, and May 11, 2020.Though bulls were in the driver's seat following each of the three halvings, the magnitude and the time taken to reach the eventual peak differed.More importantly, the macroeconomic environment on those occasions differed from today's high inflation, high-interest rate climate. Back then, M2 money supply of major central banks – U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and People's Bank of China – grew rapidly, as CoinDesk reported last year. Interest rates were stuck at or below zero in the advanced world, which catalyzed risk-taking across the financial market, including cryptocurrencies.Read more: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin HalvingIn other words, for history to repeat itself, macro conditions need to be supportive of risk-taking.That's not the case today: Interest rates in the U.S., the world's largest economy, stand above 5% and markets have recently priced out hopes of cuts this year in the light of sticky inflation and a resilient economy.The bitcoin price has rallied 50% this year, reaching record highs well ahead of the halving, thanks to inflows into the U.S.-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and has risen over 130% in six months. According to Bloomberg, the 11 spot-based ETFs, which went live three months ago, have amassed $59.2 billion in assets under management, creating a demand-supply imbalance.As such, some analysts believe the major portion of the usual post-halving surge has been brought forward, leaving the door open for a sell-the-fact pullback after the April 20 halving.According to Goldman, BTC's halving is a \"psychological reminder to investors of BTC's capped supply,\" and the medium-term outlook depends on the uptake of the ETFs.\"Whether BTC halving will next week turn out to be a “buy the rumour, sell the news event” is arguably less impactful on BTC’s medium term outlook, as BTC price performance will likely continue to be driven by the said supply-demand dynamic and continued demand for BTC ETFs, which combined with the self-reflexive nature of crypto markets is the primary determinant for spot price action,\" the team wrote.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "Bitcoin's next quadrennial halving is imminent – now likely to happen Friday or early Saturday. But a large number of the 15-year-old blockchain's developers and users are turning their attention to an event that's expected to take place immediately following the halving: the launch of Casey Rodarmor's Runes protocol.Rodarmor's big project release last year – the Ordinals protocol for creating NFT-like \"inscriptions\" on Bitcoin – brought a fresh spirit of playfulness and development vigor to the notoriously conservative blockchain's ecosystem, while showering crypto miners with a cumulative $256 million in revenue. (The popularity of the transactions caused knotty problems like network congestion and soaring user fees, among the tradeoffs.)The Runes protocol, which will allow users to spin up scads of tokens atop Bitcoin like those commonly seen on other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, could build on the success of Ordinals. But the arrival of Rodarmor's new platform could also fundamentally stretch the boundaries of what has previously been considered acceptable in Bitcoin culture, where any digital tokens besides the native cryptocurrency bitcoin have long been viewed as taboo.Ordinals allowed attaching pieces of data known as \"inscriptions\" to satoshis, the smallest denomination of BTC – effectively allowing for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be minted and traded on Bitcoin, an activity that was previously only available on other blockchains. Soon afterward, another developer, Domo, unveiled \"BRC-20\" – a standard for creating fungible, or tradable, tokens, another feature that hadn't previously existed on Bitcoin.Rodarmor himself has described Runes as a more efficient method of creating new tokens atop Bitcoin, writing in a in a post on X on April 1 that the protocol was \"built for degens and memecoins.\"\"I'm creating a venue for people to create sh*tcoins,\" Rodarmor said in February on an episode of his podcast, Hell Money.The question is whether they will take off, the way Ordinals did.Runes' 'Simplicity and Security'Rodarmor describes Runes as a protocol and token standard that can address some of the shortcomings of BRC-20.With BRC-20, users can only transfer one type of token to one destination with one inscription. Runes, however, will allow users to fan out different tokens in a single transaction that transfer any number of Runes from the inputs to the outputs.Rodarmor says Runes will offer greater simplicity and security to users than the current BRC-20 standard does.\"To transfer a BRC-20 token takes three transactions due to the way inscriptions work. You need two transcriptions to create the inscriptions and one to transfer the resulting inscription to the recipient,\" Rodarmor told CoinDesk in an interview.\"The other shortcoming is complexity. BRC-20 is essentially a superset of Ordinals inscriptions, whereby if you're writing a BRC-20 index, you have to include an Ordinals index and then additionally add the logic for the BRC-20 on top of that.\"Runes, by comparison, is a standalone protocol with no dependencies on Ordinals, Rodarmor said.It is also designed to be more efficient. With the exception of creating a rune, which is done by a two-inscription process, everything else takes one transaction.\"The transactions are very small and the transfers are very efficient,\" he added.The first rune, technically \"rune 0\" has been named by Rodarmor as \"UNCOMMON•GOODS,\" he said.\"It has an open mint, starting on the halving and ending on the next halving,\" Rodarmor said. \"It is indivisible, so the unit can't be divided into subunits, and each mint transaction gets one unit.\"Bitcoin Halving and RunesThere's no real technical reason that Runes needs to launch right at the halving.It is just \"thematically cool,\" Rodarmor said.However, he does argue there are post-halving trends that Runes will influence.The halving – Bitcoin's fourth in its 15-year history, a core feature of Satoshi Nakamoto's original programming – will see miners' reward for adding new blocks to Bitcoin cut by 50% from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.The security of Bitcoin is tied to the difficulty of the network, or the number of hashes needed to add a new block. Should the hash rate fall because the block reward has been slashed by 50%, among many potential reasons, the network would be less secure, since it would be easier to add new blocks.\"The halving programming is a very aggressive schedule,\" Rodarmor said. \"I wouldn't advocate changing it, but if I was going to design Bitcoin from scratch, I probably would not have picked such a fast decay.\"As a result of the halving, the network's security may become more reliant on transaction fees – the small amounts of bitcoin paid to miners to validate a transaction by including it in the latest block.The halving of block rewards would then need to be offset by an increase in BTC's price, incentivizing more mining activity and thereby increasing the hash rate. Should this not happen though, fees would need to increase instead.\"We already frequently see blocks where the fee is greater than the block subsidy, and that will become more common over time with each halving,\" Rodarmor said.Runes could therefore play a part in generating sources of demand for block space, helping to drive up fees that could become more important in securing the network.This view is by no means universal in the Bitcoin community. Ordinals proved controversial among some developers for causing congestion on the network and bringing out a spike in fees, an accusation Runes may face as well – if it proves successful.How does Runes work?Runes builds on Ordinals by using UTXOs – unspent transaction outputs, a key element of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's network design – to generate transactions. UTXO is the term for the amounts of crypto left over after a transaction, similar to change remaining after completing a purchase in cash.The new protocol extends the UTXO concept through the ability to hold a balance in any number of Runes tokens. A single Rune can contain 10 units of Rune A, 100 units of Rune B and 1,000 units of Rune C, and so on, with any UTXOs unspent by a transaction destroyed.Users would therefore send a bunch of Runes on different inputs, which will be transferred to an OP_RETURN to be burned. That is unless they mark it with a \"Runestone,\" a pointer that specifies an alternative output, rendering them non-spendable and thus ignored by Bitcoin Core, the network's software. A Runestone could be used to create a new Rune, known as \"etching,\" or mint or transfer existing Runes.Rodarmor sums up Runes as a \"simple OP_RETURN-based protocol,\" as presented through around 2,000 lines of code.The concept of not creating leftover UTXOs is \"a very simple strict improvement over BRC-20,\" Bitcoin entrepreneur Dan Held wrote in a blog post earlier this month.\"Inscriptions have doubled the size of the UTXO set in just the past year and the majority of those are forever useless,\" he wrote.Read More: Bitcoin Meme Coin PUPS Fuelled by Hype Ahead of Runes Release"

        "content": "Spot bitcoin ETF flows have slowed after weeks of heavy buying.Only IBIT, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, continues its streak of consecutive daily positive flows.This is a normal development within the ETF space, an expert said.The initial euphoria for the spot bitcoin ETFs has seemingly dampened and reality is slowly kicking in with inflows recently unable to keep up with the still speedy pace of exits from Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).The result is that in the week ended April 12, the spot ETFs as a whole saw a net outflow of 1,766 bitcoins.On last Friday and again on Monday, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) had inflows of $0, breaking its streak of daily additions that started at launch on January 11. That leaves BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as the only spot bitcoin ETF left that's experienced an unbroken string of inflows since the vehicles began trading.For most of the remaining funds, including the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR), among others, zero inflows and even the occasional outflow has become the norm.This is not out of the ordinary, said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in a post on X. He points out that around 83% of all ETFs on the U.S. market saw zero inflows on Monday, for example.Seyffart explained that the creation and redemption of shares of an ETF only takes place when a large enough mismatch in supply and demand exists and the cost to do so is lower than hedging. In the case of the bitcoin ETFs, these creation units range anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 shares. “Minor mismatches will see the market makers handle trading of shares just like they would a stock,” Seyffart wrote.The recent slowdown doesn’t however mean that traders need to get used to lower flows. While the initial sentiment for the ETFs in the first few weeks of existence certainly resulted in volume higher than any other ETFs have seen before, traders could see more significant positive flows in the future.“There is surely potential for a resurgence in inflows,” said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, which converted its bitcoin futures fund into a spot bitcoin ETF in March.“Many banks, endowments, and pension funds worldwide are only now beginning their due diligence processes before considering strategic allocations to BTC through newly launched ETFs,\" Kerbage continued. \"As these large financial institutions make decisions over the coming months, it is likely that inflows will increase once again, potentially reaching new milestones for what has been one of the most successful ETF launches in US history.”Turning to Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which continues to see outflows of 1,000 or more bitcoins on a daily basis, Seyffart isn't anticipating a reversal. “I do not really expect inflows into GBTC as it’s currently constructed,” he told CoinDesk. “With GBTC at a 1.5% expense ratio, I would be surprised if GBTC saw any net inflow days and shocked if it saw sustained inflows over any time period.”Edited by Stephen Alpher."

        "content": "On April 19, or whenever a bitcoin miner mines block number 840,000, the amount of bitcoin (BTC) entering into circulation will halve from about 900 a day to 450. This event, colloquially known as the halving (sometimes halvening), looms large in the Bitcoin mindshare, one of those things that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. Perhaps because it only comes around on Leap Years (so far), bitcoiners tend to look forward to the halving more than most crypto holidays like Bitcoin Pizza Day or the anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto publishing the white paper. But it won't be around forever.This roundup is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.Once all 21 million bitcoins are mined, the halving will have served its purpose and cease (likely in 2140). Why did Nakamoto make it this way? No one knows. Just like there's no real insight into why he chose a 21 million cap or Jan. 9 as launch day. There are many, many guesstimates that try to make sense of these seemingly arbitrary elements of Bitcoin's design. Because if there's one thing certain about Bitcoin, it's that it tends to split opinions.And so, with an event as anticipated as the halving there are certainly things to argue over. Is it \"priced in\" (meaning will the reduction in supply of bitcoins entering the market cause a rally)? Will the reduced revenues drive bitcoin miners bankrupt? Will this time be any different?CoinDesk turned to the crypto community to get their say:Priced in?Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital:I am a longtime halving nihilist. The halving is *what it means* for bitcoin to be deflationary. It's been priced in since the first time someone bought bitcoin because it has a fixed supply. The timing of the halving has been baked in since Bitcoin was first launched six years ago.People drawing charts and rainbows and all this nonsense over an event that has deterministically happened four times (on an asset that already goes up almost every single year) is pseudoscientific nonsense. But whatever, it's a good story.Austin Campbell, assistant professor at Columbia Business School:As bitcoin gains more of a foothold in traditional finance, events that were drivers of past cycles like the halving will cease to have as much of an impact, if any. Portfolio allocators think in multi-year and multi-decade terms, and the impact of events like the halving will be muted as this market segment grows, just like any market growing from new to mainstream sees volatility due to small idiosyncratic events decrease as liquidity and scale increase.Azeem Khan, co-founder of Morph:My personal opinion is the halving is likely priced in. We’ve seen institutional capital inflows for months now since the bitcoin spot ETF was approved. And even before that we were seeing a lot of liquidity enter the market without seeing traditional signs that retail was buying with things like Coinbase being the number one app in the App Store. To me, that indicated it was already institutional money coming in. They’re not dumb and have likely been buying ahead of this. Larry Fink didn’t get to where he is by accident.My personal philosophy in this space has tended to be that when everyone agrees something is going to happen, it generally doesn’t. Similar to when we had Elon being a clown on SNL pumping $DOGE in 2021 and everyone had agreed it was going to $1, it dumped.The investing approach I abide by has always been to dollar cost average. Pick an amount you’re willing to lose, set an auto buy for that amount of whichever assets you’ve done your research on, continue to buy over the long term every X period, and never look at the price. If you’re investing with a long term approach in mind, this will help you beat out 99% of the noise you see from gambling addicts, some of which turned out to be the lottery winners of Crypto Twitter when zooming out through the years.Not priced inEdan Yago, founder of Sovryn:Definitely not priced in. Not even close. This is the most important halving since the first. This halving will bring new assets to Bitcoin in the form of Runes and the coming cycle will see Bitcoin Rollups add scalability and programmability to Bitcoin. Bitcoin block space will go from cheap to the scarcest computing resource in the world.Ogle, founder of Glue:I think this halving is distinct from prior ones because of the significant increase in capital coming into the market because of the ETF approvals. So you have a reduction of supply because of the halving itself, combined with increased demand from the ETFs — basic economic principles say this should result in a higher price. My guess is the halving has partially been priced in, but I don't think people quite realize the magnitude of buy pressure that is coming in via the ETFs — and that buy pressure is in my view going to significantly impact the price of BTC upward.Uncle Rockstar Developer, core contributor to BTCPay:Given the historical data — 9,575% increase post-2012, 3,233% post-2016, and 667% post-2020 — it's not a question of if the BTC/USD price will rise after this halving, but rather by how much. Feel free to quote me on that.This time it’s different (or not)Ed Hindi, chief investment officer at Tyr Capital:Bitcoin remains a viable doomsday asset in 2024, as its correlation to gold recently increased, and investors continue to diversify away from traditional financial assets. The ETF is currently spearheading this doomsday rally and we should expect $120,000 to be hit in the coming months as global geopolitics continues to deteriorate and the middle classes continue to find ways to protect their wealth.We believe that price action ahead and post-halving is going to be different from past events as there are new variables affecting bitcoin. The combination of an uncertain geopolitical situation, choppy U.S. spot ETF flows, record leverage and recalibration of the U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy is going to create an explosive combo and lead to extremely volatile market conditions. We would not be surprised to see BTC trade as low as $55,000 and as high as $75,000 in the coming couple of weeks. We remain very bullish into year-end though and consider $120,000 to be a realistic target.Roger Ver, creator of Bitcoin Cash:Nothing special happened for the last three halvings. I don’t expect this time to be any different.See also: The Bitcoin Halving Really Is Different This TimeKadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer of Komodo Platform:The biggest difference between the 2020 halving and the 2024 halving is skyrocketing institutional demand. Prior to the previous halving, institutions were on the sidelines. The market was dominated by retail investors. Since then, the market dynamic has drastically shifted. As one example, MicroStrategy didn’t make its first BTC purchase until August 2020. As of April 2024, the company reportedly holds 214, 246 BTC (roughly $13.625 billion). Of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, around 12.27% currently belong to publicly traded and private companies, ETFs and countries.Adam Blumberg, co-founder of Interaxis:The halving will have likely an impact on the price, as we have greater demand than ever from ETF investors, bitcoin hodlers and even corporations, and we're coupling that with decreasing new supply. We'll also see impact on miners who have tremendous capital and electricity outlays, and will get their production cut in half.Impact on miningColin Harper, researcher and writer for Luxor Technology’s Hashrate Index:This halving could be unprecedented with regards to how it affects Bitcoin's total network hashrate. It's plausible that we see no hashrate come offline after the halving, or that we will see the smallest decrease in network hashrate after any other halving event in Bitcoin's history. Mining margins won't be as good after the halving as they are now, obviously, but they won't be horrendous. And if the new Runes fungible token protocol makes a significant impact on transaction fees, then margins will be healthy enough to keep miners with higher costs online for longer than not.For comparison, Bitcoin's hash rate declined 15% after the 2020 halving, 5% after 2016's halving, and 13% after 2012.See also: Why Bitcoin Halving Calculators Are Out of SyncJoe Downie, chief marketing officer at NiceHash:This halving is different, we will likely see less volatility than previous ones, for a few reasons: one is that Bitcoin mining is far stronger than it has ever been before in terms of hashrate, another is the level of legitimacy Bitcoin has gotten recently due to institutional funds and ETFs, plus the fact that a lot of people are in “wait and see” mode. This makes for a far more stable basis for BTC to hold its current value and gradually increase over the course of this year. There may be some short term volatility during the following week or two after the halving, but I expect things to stabilize quickly after that.Troy Cross, professor of philosophy at Reed College:There are two sides of the halving story: price impact and mining impact. On the price side, I don't have anything to say. The \"supply shock *should* be priced in, but every time I have thought that and every time I've been wrong. I won't pretend to read the collective psyche. With everyone anticipating that everyone else is irrational and *not* pricing it in, who knows what will happen?I tweeted recently about the U.S. government’s holdings of bitcoin, over 200,000 bitcoins, and much of it Silk Road seizure. In terms of the impact on supply, that's at least as important as the halving event.But on the mining side, the halving does get me excited.The halving will force miners to seek out even cheaper power than they already have. Some miners will go under, selling off their equipment to those with more efficient operations.The breakeven point for profitably running an ASIC will nearly drop in half. Miners will start curtailing more often, particularly their older machines.What happens next depends on bitcoin's price action, but if prices do not rise dramatically, we will see a dip in hashrate while ASICs find cheaper homes, and then mining will settle into its \"dung beetle\" role, consuming only wasted, stranded energy.The differences between a cost-sensitive consumer of energy like bitcoin and traditional data centers or AI data centers--or really any other electricity consumer--are already clear, but after the halving, bitcoin's flexibility — shutting down whenever electricity prices rise — and its opportunism, finding pockets of currently-stranded energy, bottlenecked by transmission constraints, will be even more dramatic.Maria Bustillos, founder of Flaming Hydra, a part of the Brick House co-op:I just hope this finally, FINALLY gets people reckoning the gigantic difference in environmental costs between PoW and PoS blockchains.Effects on adoptionPeter Todd, founder of OpenTimestamps and Bitcoin Core developer:The halving is one of the dumbest parts of how Bitcoin was designed. If you're going to reduce subsidy over time, the right way to do it is gradually, rather than shocking the system every four years. Fortunately fees are getting higher, so the risk of havings is reducing. Hopefully this one goes alright.Fortunately fees are getting higher, so the risk of havings is reducing. Hopefully this one goes alright.Zooko Wilcox, founder of Zcash:I’m interested in the Bitcoin halving because of supply effects. I have come to frankly detest that part of the markets which is independent of fundamentals. You know what I mean: hype, narrative, people buying when they see something go up and selling when they see something go down. The Keynesian Beauty Contest, the Greater Fool Theory. Memecoins. Memestocks. Pump and dumps. Insider trading. Misinformation/disinformation/FUD. I was always naturally against such stuff, but my long painful experience in the crypto world has made me hate it.Bitcoin’s and Zcash’s assured supply limits is the very opposite of that — the thing that no amount of hype or misinformation or mass mania can touch. And it’s interesting to think about the difference between talking about the supply of Bitcoin and Zcash being 21 million, versus talking about it being the ongoing addition to the supply from mining.Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital:The Bitcoin halving is the programmatic mechanism that creates and enforces bitcoin’s most famous quality: its scarcity. While this fourth halving reduction in new daily issuance from ~900 BTC to ~450 BTC is small in absolute terms and relative to BTC’s daily float of $10-$25 billion, nonetheless prices are set on the margin. But beyond any supply impact – which I believe is marginal – this is the first halving in which major U.S. asset managers are educating on Bitcoin, and there’s no better Bitcoin education than learning about the halving. It’s a narrative event first – a quadrennial market moment – and a supply event second, though I think both aspects will be impactful.Tatiana Koffman, general partner at Moonwalker Capital and author of the Myth of Money newsletter:The most significant impact of the Bitcoin halving is its influence on the energy input and mining difficulty of Bitcoin, which inherently supports a higher baseline price for the cryptocurrency.This phenomenon can be closely likened to gold mining, where the principle of scarcity plays a crucial role. As more gold is extracted, the remaining reserves become increasingly scarce, making it more challenging and costly to find and extract new deposits. This requires more investment in exploration and advanced machinery for mining and processing the gold.See also: Will the Next Bitcoin Halving Be Another Hype Cycle?Similarly, Bitcoin's scarcity is engineered through a difficulty adjustment algorithm that halves the mining rewards roughly every four years. This not only reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced but also adjusts the mining difficulty to maintain a steady rate of block creation, regardless of the total computational power on the network. This mechanism ensures that as Bitcoin becomes scarcer, the effort and cost to mine it increase, supporting its price over time.The halving mechanism is fundamental to preserving Bitcoin's integrity as a store of value. It underscores the cryptocurrency's deflationary nature, which is critical for its long-term valuation and the security of its network. By intentionally reducing the influx of new Bitcoins, the halving events reinforce Bitcoin's status as a digital equivalent of gold, making it a potentially attractive option for future generations looking for reliable value preservation in the face of inflationary fiat currencies.Bradley Rettler, philosophy professor at the University of Wyoming:The bitcoin halving has two purposes. The first is to attract attention, thereby drawing ever more people into the network. The second is to reassure people that the rules are still in charge.Anil Lulla, co-founder of Delphi Digital:I think the halving is always just a great marketing event built into Bitcoin every four years. It obviously has an impact on its supply, but more than that it gets everyone to pay attention to the asset and how it works. I think this halving is extra special because of two things (1) The ETF and (2) the Bitcoin Renaissance happening right now. The ETF is straightforward and widely covered, so I’ll focus on (2). Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20s. I don’t think the Bitcoin ecosystem has had this much excitement around it in years. It’s driving a lot of attention, experimentation and innovation to Bitcoin at a time when it’s much needed.Burak Tamac, adjunct professor at Montclair State University:The Bitcoin halving reduces barriers to adoption in three key ways:1. The concept is not only easy to understand, but we need something to contrast when learning new concepts.2. Comparing the halving to fiat money supply highlights the direct contrast between the two. However, these two factors alone won't drive rapid mass adoption. This is where the third point becomes crucial:3. It is also very easy to explain. New bitcoiners can quickly understand and convincingly share the concept with others.What distinguishes this halving is that not only bitcoiners but also major financial institutions have been educating their clients about its importance.Institutional interestDavid Zane Morris, editor of the Dark Markets newsletter:I expect a price rise after the halving, largely thanks to the new ETFs. There are a lot of new investors who are still learning the nuances of Bitcoin, and there is now a very easy way for them to buy into sentiment or narratives. That lack of friction is the truly new factor here, and I expect it to matter.James Wester, a tech analyst at Javelin Strategy:This halving is definitely coming at an interesting time as we are still figuring out the effects of the bitcoin ETFs on demand. That makes it harder to determine how much of the halving is effectively priced in. That said, all of the issues that have gotten us here still remain--the ETFs, institutional interest--so it is reasonable to believe that demand will continue to drive the price up in the longer term.Aubrey Strobel, advisor to Trust Machines, Lolli and Pubkey:Consider this — in just a span of three or four months, we've witnessed the launch of 11 bitcoin ETFs, with four of them marking the most successful debuts in history. The combined capital in these ETFs has already exceeded 50% of the assets under management (AUM) in gold, a milestone achieved in a fraction of the time it took for gold to reach its current status over 20 years. Now, with only 450 new bitcoins entering the market daily, coupled with significant investments from major asset managers like Fidelity, Blackrock and also Michael Saylor, the demand-supply dynamics are evident. It's simple math to anticipate the trajectory ahead.What critics sayMolly White, author the Citation Needed newsletter:Although responsible investment advisers will often warn that \"past performance is no guarantee of future results\", that's largely the kind of thought process that goes into predictions for the halving. \"Number went up last time, so number go up again\". More sophisticated explainers might delve into supply and demand, suggesting that the gradual closing of the bitcoin faucet amid roughly steady demand is what drives prices higher. Either way, some people are piling into bitcoin in belief of guaranteed double-your-money returns, if not better.These folks might do well to be a bit more cautious.See also: How the Bitcoin Halving Could Affect Network SecurityGwern, polymath: Bitcoin has been boring for a long time. I can't think of a single thing about Bitcoin in the past four years I'd actually feel excited to write about. even stuff like Lightning slowly whimpering out should've been old news in 2020.Bennett Tomlin, head of research at Protos:The Bitcoin halving serves the important function of reducing the incentives to waste energy on Bitcoin and ensuring that many poorly run bitcoin miners will once again be forced to confront the challenging economics of their businesses.Bitfinex'ed, Tether critic:It’s not events that dictate price in crypto, prices in this market are determined by the heads of the market, notably Tether and their co-conspirators.If you want a quote from an influential person, Giancarlo Devasini, the CFO of Tether.“Illiquid markets such as bitcoin are easy prey for manipulation”, being as the primary trading pair is Tether and not the U.S. dollar, the prices are whatever he wants them to be.UPDATE (APRIL 16, 2024): Adds quotes from Maria Bustillos, Aubrey Strobel, James Wester, David Zane Morris and Zooko Wilcox."

        "content": "Crypto correction has clobbered investor sentiment, but there are still plenty of reasons to stay bullish on digital assets, analysts say.Leverage wipe-out made the market \"much healthier,\" a K33 analyst said.Bitcoin halving may have positive impact on price with spot BTC ETFs reaching a wider audience, an LMAX Group strategist noted.Stock market weakness could weigh on crypto assets, but drop would be short-lived with other narratives at play, macro analyst Noelle Acheson said.Crypto markets took a sizable gut punch over the weekend, sending investors' sentiment to the basement from euphoric highs only a few weeks ago.Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled below $62,000 on Tuesday, lower by more than 15% from its latest record price above $73,000, while altcoin darlings solana (SOL), pepe coin (PEPE) and dogwifhat {{WIF}} suffered 40%-50% setbacks from recent highs.Despite the sizable drawdown across the board, there are still a handful of reasons to be bullish on digital assets even if prices cool off further or chop sideways for a while.Bitcoin halving effectBitcoin will undergo its fourth halving later this week, a recurring event in roughly every four years when the newly issued supply of tokens – the rewards for miners – will be cut in half. Historically, bitcoin's price didn't move much around the time of halving, but the event preceded parabolic rallies.\"As far as the halving event goes, we’ve been in the camp where we don’t expect there to be much additional upside momentum,\" said Joel Kruger, a market strategist at LMAX Group, adding that \"this is a known event that has been well telegraphed by the market.\"However, with spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) listed in the U.S. from traditional finance giants like BlackRock and Fidelity starting ramping up their sales machines to financial advisors and wealth managers introducing bitcoin to a broader investor base, this halving might bring some tailwinds for bitcoin's price.\"At the same time, we do believe there is some room for a rally when considering this is the first bitcoin halving that will be playing out in front of a much wider audience, now that the bitcoin spot ETFs are up and running,\" Kruger pointed out.\"The halving event could therefore get these investors more excited about bitcoin, as they are forced to take a deeper dive, which could then translate to the desire to take on even more exposure,\" he added.Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, last week noted BlackRock advertising its bitcoin fund IBIT on financial news outlet Bloomberg's homepage.Defying macro turbulenceWhile momentum on crypto markets faltered over the past weeks, the catalyst that eventually kickstarted to correction last Friday stemmed from macro events. Traditional markets turned jittery on increasing fears of military escalation between Israel and Iran, while bond yields and the U.S. dollar rose sharply as investors priced out rate cut expectations amid strong U.S. economic data and rising concerns of sticky inflation.Noelle Acheson, macro analyst and author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, pointed out that the earnings yield on the S&P 500 is now below that of both 3-month and the 10-year U.S. Treasuries, which could foreshadow further downside for U.S. equities. The relation should be the other way, to compensate investors for the higher risk in owning stocks rather than bonds, she explained.\"If [the stock market] drops sharply, BTC and other crypto assets could get temporarily hit as well,\" Acheson said.However, \"the crypto drop would be short-lived, though, as other ongoing narratives – store of value, halving, currency hedge, new use cases, growing adoption – will encourage accumulation at lower levels,\" she added.Acheson said that there might be some potential good news on the short-term that would offer relief from rising yields that squeezed risk assets recently, although it's not very likely.\"The Federal Reserve could revert to insisting that rate cuts are imminent, which should temper the rise in yields,\" she said. \"I'm not expecting this, but if it happens, risk assets should do well.\"Leverage wipe outMassive liquidation events on derivatives markets often mark the bottom for asset prices, wiping out excessive leverage and cleansing the market from exuberance. Crypto markets endured one of their most brutal leverage flush, liquidating over $1.5 billion of bullish bets on Friday and Saturday combined.Total crypto liquidations per day (CoinGlass)\"The market is now much healthier,\" Vetle Lunde, senior market analyst at K33 Research said. \"Both open interest and funding rates have been drastically reduced, reducing the likelihood of liquidation cascades onwards.\"\"This, accompanied by a bitcoin holding firm above $60,000, is a robust signal,\" Lunde added.The events are reminiscent of last August's action, when BTC plunged from $28,000 to near $24,000 with liquidations nearing $1 billion across all digital assets. Following the largest daily drawdown since the FTX crash, prices hovered in a range for almost two very dull months until October's breakout above $30,000 to much higher prices.Typical bull market pullbackWith BTC pulling back 16% from its recent all-time high in March, the current drawdown is in line with typical drawdowns of previous bull markets.The 2016-2017 and 2020-2021 bull cycles all had multiple 20%-30% pullbacks before continuing to much higher prices. \"Few understand how normal corrections like these are in bull markets,\" crypto analyst On-Chain College said in an X post.Despite the current nervousness, hedge fund QCP Capital said Tuesday that it continued to see consistent, sizable demand for BTC and ETH calls for longer-term expiries out to March 2025, signaling that market participants still expect higher prices coming.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

        "content": "On or around April 19, the fourth Bitcoin halving will take place, cutting in half the rewards miners receive for solving a block on the Bitcoin blockchain. The halving event is programmed into Bitcoin's protocol every 210,000 blocks and occurs roughly every four years. It is designed to limit the digital asset’s total supply and establish a fundamental scarcity. Therefore, efficiency is critical for bitcoin (BTC) mining companies to remain competitive as the 2024 halving approaches and even as the following halving in 2028 is considered.To prepare, bitcoin miners must examine three key areas of their business: power, operations and software.This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.Adam Sullivan is CEO of Core Scientific, a bitcoin mining firm.Power is bitcoin miners' single largest cost item and it bounds the ability to bring hashrate online. By nature of the highly competitive market, miners only target low-cost and stranded power. Optimizing the efficiency of mining operations is extremely important and is driven mainly by the energy efficiency of the Bitcoin mining machines in a company’s fleet. To compensate for the revenue cut, miners are improving average fleet energy efficiency by replacing older, less efficient miners with the latest and most efficient miners. Overall, more efficient fleets will improve margin profiles and competitive positioning within the industry.See also: The Halving Highlights Why Bitcoin Needs to UpgradeAnother way that miners can cut power costs is by relocating to locations with lower power prices, many of which are in developing economies. However, developing economies tend to have less reliable electrical grids, frequently driven by less reliable transmission infrastructure, increasing the likelihood of power interruption and downtime for miners. Lower power pricing with greater downtime may offset the benefits of establishing operations in those locations. Companies can also extend the lifespan and value of their machines by having different types of power contracts within their portfolio, allowing them to allocate machines based on their efficiency.In addition to maximizing the energy efficiency of machines, miners must also work to maximize the utilization of their energized hash rate to ensure that they earn the highest quantity of bitcoin possible and generate the highest return on their investment. Maximizing hash rate utilization depends on the quality of a company’s mining infrastructure and the ability of its data center operations teams to maintain fleet performance at the highest productivity levels possible. Data centers should be located, designed and operated to maximize the performance of the machines for as long as they are profitable and minimize downtime, using the latest technologies and approaches.See also: The Rise of ASICs: A Step-by-Step History of Bitcoin Mining (2020)As bitcoin mining companies scale their operations, their ability to manage a growing fleet of mining equipment becomes a critical enabler of efficiency and hash rate utilization, particularly when their operations span multiple geographic locations. Software solutions that provide fleet management and optimization for hundreds of thousands or millions of miners enable efficient, scaled operations across time zones and borders. Combined with energy management software that provides control of a mining fleet in response to changes in power pricing, bitcoin mining companies depend on software to optimize operations and maximize profitability.Bitcoin miners who have not optimized their existing infrastructure, built their own high-performing data center team, developed their own software stack, and managed their power contracts effectively will face a difficult period after the halving. They will be highly vulnerable to larger players who have the infrastructure to dramatically improve their operations. As a result, the bitcoin mining industry will likely see consolidation as miners with access to more capital continue to expand their operations opportunistically. To remain competitive, it is even more important for smaller miners to prioritize efficient, productive operations.By design, bitcoin is a finite resource, and mining for bitcoin will be increasingly competitive with each succeeding year. By reallocating existing sites and resources to support other forms of compute, miners can effectively future proof their power allocations as they shift their mining operations to locations that will be profitable in 2028 and beyond."

        "content": "Amid a rekindling of Bitcoin development fervor, layer-2 network Stacks is looking to reinvent itself. As early as April 16, the major player in the Bitcoin L2 sector will kick off the release of its so-called Nakamoto upgrade, in the works for years – designed to dramatically increase the project's speed.This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.UnmuteIt’s a defining moment for the blockchain project that has been in development for nearly half a decade, but officially launched its mainnet in 2021. In short: Stacks is an attempt to scale Bitcoin by creating a dedicated chain for cheaper and faster transactions and Ethereum-like smart contract programmability, but maintains Bitcoin’s strong finality and security powered by miners.“In a way, [Nakamoto is] sort of fulfilling the original intent of Stacks,” Stacks creator Muneeb Ali said in an interview with CoinDesk, referring to a message Stacks developers encoded into the network’s Genesis block that cited an idea Satoshi Nakamoto had about a universe of blockchain’s that “share” computational power with Bitcoin. “Now that will be possible.”The upgrade comes at a time of exploding interest in Bitcoin L2s, largely driven by the “Ordinals revolution” that began last year that made it possible to launch a number of never-before-seen tokens – from meme coins to NFT-like “inscriptions” – on a blockchain once thought to be in development hell.See also: Casey Rodarmor: The Bitcoin ArtistAlongside BTC’s dramatic 50% rise since the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in January, Stack’s native token, STX, has risen over 70%. The token has gained over 250% since the launch of the Ordinals Protocol, pushing it into the ranking of the top 30 largest tokens.So what is the Nakamoto upgrade?The Nakamoto upgrade is a way to decouple Stacks from Bitcoin in one sense while also bringing the two networks closer together.Like many L2s, Stacks ultimately settles transactions run on its own network directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, meaning that while Stacks transactions were technically faster and cheaper than Bitcoin transactions, they could only be considered irreversible when Bitcoin miners finally add a block to the blockchain (i.e. every 10 minutes).Nakamoto, which will kick off at Bitcoin block height 840,360, will address this problem of slow settlement speed essentially by introducing a form of parallel processing that allows Stacks miners to produce multiple blocks in between Bitcoin blocks.This will work due to a modification in Stack’s consensus mechanism, which is a blend of proof-of-stake and mining called “proof-of-transfer.” In essence, instead of burning energy like bitcoin miners, Stacks induces an economic cost to maintaining the blockchain by having Stacks miners buy bitcoin and send it to a predetermined address, which is then distributed to Stacks validators; in return, miners get STX.After Nakamoto, the network’s validators (called stackers) will still receive BTC for validating blocks and Stacks miners will still receive STX, but the process speeds up. What’s changed is the introduction of “tenures,” or a period of time that individual miners are assigned to produce multiple blocks that then ultimately resolve down to the Bitcoin.Read More: Bitcoin Halving Has Crypto Miners Racing for 'Epic Sat' Potentially Worth MillionsUnder developmentNakamoto has more or less been under development since Stacks released its mainnet, after which the network was running at capacity in a matter of months. “Users were complaining that they want to use this thing but the block times are just extremely slow,” Ali, who has a Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University. “It made it crystal clear.”By December 2022, Stacks developers had released two white papers proposing network changes: one for Nakamoto and one for a separate upgrade planned for later this year, the “trust minimized” bridge called sBTC to make it easier to port over BTC into the Stacks economy.See also: Bitcoin First, Not Only | OpinionIn the spirit of decentralization, Ali said, no author names were added to the papers. Upwards of 30 engineers from a number of Stacks related entities contributed to the effort.The rollout of sBTC will trail Nakamoto by two to three months, according to the current roadmap estimations. And while not as big of a technical overhaul of the Stacks network itself, the ability to bridge over BTC onto Stacks may be an even bigger deal for the network’s economy.Although smaller both in terms of total value locked and the number of available applications than on chains like Ethereum and Solana, Stack’s decentralized finance (DeFi) economy is arguably the most mature pertaining to Bitcoin. But apart from yield games or decentralized exchanges, Ali said he’s particularly interested in seeing a Stripe-like payments system launch to finally make commercial Bitcoin applications realistically possible, now that people won’t have to wait 10 minutes to know whether their $5 coffee order went through.“What I'm feeling the most proud of is this may be a massive improvement to Bitcoin UX for normal people,” Ali said. “People want a way to use their BTC.”See also: Props Shutdown Throws Reg A+ Funding Model Into LimboEdited by Bradley Keoun."

        "content": "There are plenty of reasons to be bullish on gold, but the evergreen bear case on the precious metal is that it's never really consumed. Every ounce of gold that's been mined since the beginning of time is still here.To wit is a Bloomberg story over the weekend reporting on a flood of customers rushing into a Brooklyn pawnshop with their valuables to cash in on gold's recent run to a record price above $2,400 per ounce. \"People are using gold as an ATM they never had,\" owner Gene Furman, who is seeing three times the normal traffic of sellers since the metal's rally began in earnest two months ago, told Bloomberg.Buyers appear to have gone on strike at these prices as well, with the U.S. Mint posting March American Eagle gold coin sales that were roughly 10% of the level hit a year prior.Whither bitcoin?There are clear differences between gold and bitcoin (BTC), but they share many similar properties. Among them is that bitcoin, too, is never truly consumed and all that's ever been mined is still with us (though some may be unavailable due to lost private keys).Mostly thanks to boosted demand from the spot ETFs, bitcoin by mid-March had risen nearly 70% for 2024 to a new record above $73,000. The rally has stalled since, with the price now more than 15% below that all-time high. The reasons for the pullback are up for debate, but for the last month, sellers have overwhelmed a modestly slowed but still quick pace of buying by the ETFs.While bulls like to point to just 900 bitcoin being mined per day (and with the bitcoin halving this week, that will be trimmed to 450 per day) versus ETF demand often numbering in the thousands per day, the math doesn't necessarily lead to \"number go up.\" The circulating supply of bitcoin is nearly 20 million and at a high enough price, there have been plenty of willing sellers just as happy to cash in as those rushing to Gene Furman's pawnshop.Just yesterday, in fact, an early crypto enthusiast moved 50 bitcoin mined in 2010 worth $3 million at current prices to crypto exchange Coinbase, likely with intent to sell. That follows December's move from an address that had been dormant for 13 years of more than 1,000 bitcoin worth $40 million to a trading desk.The last word on gold and possibly bitcoin goes to Tobina Kahn, president of House of Kahn Estate Jewelers. \"It's very busy and we are getting more calls than ever before about clients wanting to bring in their jewels,\" she told Bloomberg. \"I'm telling the clients to bring them in now, as we are at unprecedented levels.\"Edited by Nick Baker."

Solana (SOL) fell 12% and Avalanche declined 9%, erasing its year-to-date gains.OKX, the fourth-largest crypto exchange, said its new layer-2 blockchain, X Layer, has gone live on its public mainnet, joining other major crypto companies in starting its own distributed network. X Layer, previously known as X1, makes use of Polygon's Chain Development Kit (CDK), a customizable toolkit that lets developers build their own chains by making use of zero-knowledge technology. The firm joins other major cryptocurrency exchanges that have pursued their own layer-2 networks over the past year. In August, Coinbase launched its “Base” blockchain, which is built with Optimism’s OP Stack. Kraken is reportedly also interested in creating its own layer-2 blockchain.Bitcoin miners may have underperformed the cryptocurrency this year, but their CEOs remain upbeat as the reward halving approaches, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday. The underperformance has been caused by strong moves in spot bitcoin and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have sucked \"retail liquidity\" from mining stocks, and by concerns about the impact of the halving on miner revenues, analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are reduced, slowing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply. The next halving is due around April 19-20.Chart of the DayThe chart shows the U.S. dollar's (USD) exchange rate against the Chinese yuan (CNY).The USD/CNY pair rose to a five-month high Tuesday as the slide in the Japanese yen weighed on Asian currencies, including the Chinese yuan.The Yuan's depreciation means China is incentivized to keep bitcoin under pressure to discourage Chinese investors from using the cryptocurrency to move capital overseas, according to the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub.Source: TradingViewTrending PostsBored Ape NFT Prices Tank to August 2022 Levels, Down 90% From PeakBitcoin Could Surge to $120K on 'Doomsday Rally,' Trader SaysTON-Based Economy Starting to Take Root in Telegram, TON Foundation SaysEdited by Sheldon Reback."

Some traders say the hedging narrative remains viable despite BTC being highly correlated with traditional market assets for several years.“Bitcoin remains a viable doomsday asset in 2024, as its correlation to Gold recently increased, and investors continue to diversify away from traditional financial assets,” Edouard Hindi, the chief investment officer at Tyr Capital, said in an email to CoinDesk.“The ETF is currently spearheading this Doomsday rally and we should expect $120,000 to be hit in the coming months as global geopolitics continues to deteriorate and the middle classes continue to find ways to protect their wealth,” Hindi said.Crypto markets were shattered over the weekend as tensions between Iran and Israel increased alongside profit-taking ahead of the bitcoin reward halving, a technical event expected on April 20 that will cut network rewards by 50%.Major tokens lost as much as 18% on the weekend compared to last week’s peak prices before reversing some of the losses on Monday. The slide resumed in Asian morning hours on Tuesday as Israel considered its response to Iran's firing of more than 300 drones and missiles at its territory.Elsewhere, inflows to bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) have slowed in the past week. Data shows only one product, BlackRock’s IBIT, saw inflows on Monday, while 10 other ETFs all saw outflows.Some market observers say bitcoin’s short-term price action will set the course for the broader crypto market in the coming weeks.“The sell-off in US stock markets affected global risk appetite late on Monday, reversing initial positivity. The market is hovering near the lows of March,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an FxPro senior market analyst, wrote in a daily note. “This is a key moment in choosing the market’s direction for the coming weeks. A bounce out of this area will allow for the expectation of an early recovery to the recent highs. A dip below would likely trigger a broader liquidation of positions.”Edited by Sheldon Reback."

The primary trigger is the unexpected and persistent inflation. With the bond market now projecting less than three cuts and 10-year Treasury Yields surpassing 4.50%, we may have arrived at a crucial tipping point for risk assets,” Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, said in a note to clients Tuesday.“We sold all our tech stocks last night (at the open) as the Nasdaq is trading very poorly and reacting to the higher bond yield. We only hold a few high-conviction crypto coins. Overall, we are bearish risk assets (stocks + crypto).” Thielen added.Traders have recently scaled back pricing for 25 basis point Fed rate cuts this year to less than three from six at the beginning of the year, data from CMEGroup show.The so-called hawkish repricing, spurred by sticky U.S. inflation and a resilient labor market and economy, has lifted the 10-year Treasury yield 40 basis points to 4.61% this month, the highest since November 2023. The sharp rise in the so-called risk-free rate has dented the appeal of investing in high-risk/high-return assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies.\"Most of this 2023/2024 bitcoin rally is driven by expectations that interest rates would be cut, and this narrative is being seriously challenged now,\" Thielen noted, adding that inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have dried.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted nearly a dozen spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, allowing investors to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own and store it.Since then, nearly $12 billion has flowed into these investment vehicles. However, most flows happened last quarter, powering the cryptocurrency higher, and the demand has faded this month.Bitcoin ETF inflows.

Other traditional finance firms had endorsed the original cryptocurrency, to be sure, but BlackRock's blessing – in the form of filing to create a spot bitcoin ETF and vocal praise from CEO Larry Fink – was widely viewed as a surprising and significant turn of events.The tone around bitcoin (BTC) seemed to shift among finance professionals – at least some of them – in the aftermath, with more players voicing support.And, yet, earlier this month at an event in Miami for investment pros, it was clear that a significant swath of the industry continues to have serious doubts about bitcoin.\"Bitcoin is just an extractive bubble,\" Mike Green, portfolio manager at Simplify Asset Management, said at the recent Miami Investment Masters Symposium. \"It's effectively a mechanism to transfer wealth from one group of individuals to another.\"That skepticism doesn't translate into Simplify completely ignoring bitcoin, however. It offers customers two funds that are exposed to BTC: the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF and the Simplify US Equity PLUS GBTC ETF, which invests 10% of its assets in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).There is demand for bitcoin, so Simplify is meeting that desire, Green said. But this doesn't change his overall view that bitcoin is simply a mechanism to transfer wealth. \"No value has been created and nothing has been done per se.\"Bitcoin skepticism remains commonThere are signs of broader reluctance. For spot bitcoin ETFs, even though they have seen unprecedented demand for a newly released product, they are not being offered to clients of some wealth management firms, including Vanguard and State Street. Only about half a dozen prominent firms have disclosed that they let their customers invest in the funds and experts believe that most of the volume for the bitcoin ETFs comes from retail investors.Banking giant Goldman Sachs, though it plays a key role for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a so-called authorized participant, earlier this month reiterated that it doesn’t believe bitcoin belongs in investment portfolios and that its clients are not interested in the cryptocurrency.Stone X Group's chief strategist, Kathryn Vera, gave a presentation at the Miami conference, stating that bitcoin won't be a reserve currency – economics jargon for a currency like the dollar, euro or yuan held by central banks to support global trade and finance – \"in her lifetime.\" A key reason why the largest conventional currencies are cornerstones of finance is this reserve currency status.Gold fan and economist Peter Schiff called bitcoin gambling money that has no use in the present or the future. \"This whole thing is a big bubble,\" he said at the event, as bitcoin was trading around a new record high above $73,000. \"It's going to collapse.\"While some asset managers have picked their side and stand firm on their opinions, others simply aren't at the point yet where they are forced to consider the asset class as an investment – despite the recent creation in the U.S. of 11 bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale and others designed to make it easier for investors to buy bitcoin.Green said his firm isn't seeing much interest in bitcoin from its clients – though he concedes that might partly be the firm's fault as it doesn’t actively market the cryptocurrency or advise clients to invest in it.Another asset manager, who asked not to be named, said that the firm is making its clients so much money that it simply doesn't need bitcoin, especially because the crypto asset requires a level of forecasting that all of the other trades that the firm makes don't. \"Business is booming with the focus we have,\" the manager said.According to Green, a lot of his peers aren't willing to put in the work to really understand the technologies behind bitcoin and other crypto assets, especially when there is no pressure from clients to do so and because speaking negatively about the cryptocurrency or expressing skepticism or speculation in the space doesn't seem to have any negative impact, he said.As a result, there is a tremendous amount of disinformation circulating in the industry.\"There is a lack of interest in really understanding it because it's really hard to pursue something like bitcoin whole-cloth,\" he said.Edited by Nick Baker."

It’s the latest signal of the increasing institutionalization of the world’s leading crypto assets, and perhaps a harbinger of things to come in mainland China, which banned virtually all crypto activity in 2021.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteChinaAMC, Harvest Global and Bosera International are among the asset managers granted licenses to launch these spot market products by the Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), though more may follow. In recent months, Hong Kong regulators have signaled their intent to open the former citystate into a crypto hub.Notably, Hong Kong is positioning itself as one of the first regions to approve spot ether ETFs. Canada, the first country to allow the launch of bitcoin ETFs, approved ETH ETFs a few months later. In the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission’s hand was essentially forced to approve spot bitcoin ETFs is currently dragging its feet on ether-based products.Europe, Singapore, Australia and Dubai also have approved bitcoin ETFs available in their respective regions. The U.K. will soon allow crypto-traded notes to be traded on the London Stock Exchange starting in May, while Australia is expected to approve them in June this year.See also: The Bitcoin ETF Approval: Full CoverageThe Hong Kong news is positive especially considering the city’s role as a regional financial hub, perhaps opening the door for nearby neighbors like Japan and Singapore to also open the floodgates to spot bitcoin investing.However, unlike the unlock that happened in the U.S., which is one of the main drivers of the recent bitcoin rally that has pushed the asset to ever newer all-time highs, there are reasons to doubt billions in new capital will flood into the market. Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. this year have been some of the fastest growing financial products ever — already accounting for billions in assets under management.But as financial markets guru Noelle Acheson has pointed out, there is a gulf between the relative market size of the U.S. and Hong Kong.“A handful of $BTC and $ETH futures ETFs listed in Hong Kong in December 2022, and today, more than a year later, have a combined AUM of just under $170 million,” Acheson tweeted. “For contrast, $BITO – the largest U.S.-listed BTC futures ETF – has an AUM of over $2.8 billion.”"

While some advocates firmly believe in a \"Bitcoin only\" narrative, this aggressive stance can often hinder the conversation and deter potential adopters.Instead, a \"Bitcoin first\" approach, which prioritizes education and understanding, may prove more effective in fostering genuine interest and long-term investment in bitcoin.Burak Tamac is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, teaching politics and technology.This essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.The limitations of the \"Bitcoin only\" approachProponents of the \"Bitcoin only\" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins.The power of educationTo effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright.When individuals learn about the Bitcoin network's decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin's value proposition.See also: Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century | OpinionEncouraging people to blindly invest in bitcoin without proper understanding is a short-sighted approach. When individuals buy bitcoin solely based on hype or fear of missing out, they are more likely to panic sell during market fluctuations. This behavior not only harms their personal financial well-being but also discourages them to learn more about bitcoin.In contrast, when people invest in bitcoin after learning about its fundamentals and long-term potential, they are more likely to hold their investments through market cycles. This informed decision-making promotes stability and helps to build a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin community.The way forwardTo accelerate bitcoin adoption, I believe advocates should prioritize education to start a conversation; and the education should not start about what they do wrong, but what they can do more. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy and technological understanding, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers.By adopting a \"Bitcoin first\" approach that prioritizes education and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and empowering environment for newcomers.

        "content": "Bitcoin has spurred a renaissance of thought on the question of “what is money?” Bitcoin is often linked to the Austrian school of economics without much thought as to why, but pondering this question allows for the most thoughtful justification: money is an emergent order and understanding its operation depends on appreciating irreducible uncertainty, subjective value and methodological individualism. Often described as a logical treatment of a subject fundamentally resistant to scientific analysis, the emergence of Bitcoin and its acceptance in the market has many Austrians rightly cackling at a real-world proof of the efficacy of the school.Allen Farrington is a writer and investor in bitcoin. He cowrote \"Bitcoin Is Venice\" and \"Only The Strong Survive,\" and is a cofounder of Axiom, a bitcoin-focused venture firm. A version of this essay was originally published on the Axiom website.This essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.On which note, Mises’ monumental \"The Theory of Money and Credit\" is essential reading for any bitcoiner, and Menger’s \"On the Origins of Money\" might be the single best prose answer to the preceding question. More a bitcoiner himself than an Austrian – or at the very least a polymath – Nick Szabo’s writing is essential reading not only for bitcoiners, but for anybody struggling to understand what on earth is going on in the world. Contemporary Austrian economist Rahim Taghizadegan has indeed credited Szabo’s thesis in \"Shelling Out\" as a novel contribution to the school.That said, we do not think of Axiom as a “money business” – and nor does anybody else, for that matter. We operate in capital markets, and I have personally found it impossible in the past few months to set up a capital markets business without thinking about the nature of capital. The reader will not be surprised in the least to learn I believe there is an intimate connection to money, and hence that capital on a \"Bitcoin Standard\" is likely to be every bit as different as money, and possibly more so.Joseph Schumpeter’s critique of the nonsense of “equilibrium” as leaving no space for entrepreneurship is as much about capital as anything else. Without entrepreneurs, there is little to distinguish productive capital from mere assets: animate matter, rich with potential, from mere inanimate stuff. One of the many lessons of Israel Kirzner’s analysis of the conceptual links between competition and entrepreneurship is to force the realization that capital is both heterogeneous and unavoidably the product of human creativity. This heterogeneity is arguably the soundest conceptual grounding, or the best formulated axiom, for a non-circular definition of “liquidity.” The perfectly liquid capital is money, which is perfectly homogeneous. Money bears no uncertainty because it is the standard of value against which uncertain endeavors are to be measured. The role of the entrepreneur is to embrace uncertainty by accumulating capital; putting it to heterogeneous use in the creative and competitive pursuit of the satisfaction of the value of others.So far, so simple – and so seemingly axiomatic. But if you are reading this you are most likely interested in Bitcoin, and if you have been kind enough to invest in Axiom Venture Fund I then you most certainly believe that we are still early. And so, I put it to the reader that this – or, perhaps, the consequences of this – is not at all widely understood.There are plenty of definitions of capital out there, but my favorite definition is not at all technical and is not from an Austrian. It is that of Hernando de Soto. It is not even a “definition,” per se, but more of an image. This is exactly why I like it. In the dismal science, rhetorical flourish is hard to come by – especially while remaining somewhat accurate and without spiraling into statist agitprop.In his fantastic \"The Mystery of Capital\", de Soto calls capital, economic potential energy. To my mind, this helpfully emphasizes two things:that work has been done, but the fruits of that work have not been realized, and;that they can be realized, with intention – with human actionIt is within our power, not as homo economici, but as individual thinking humans, to tap this reserve of potential energy based on what we value. It is not the preserve of the omniscient, omnipotent capital tsar who allocates all capital from a palace in the sky. Nor is Hayek obsoleted by advances in artificial intelligence, to cite exactly some such fashionable statist agitprop. It is the entrepreneur that is the motor of the world. She thinks as an individual; she acts in the moment; and she allocates at the margin.Steve Jobs, an entrepreneur if ever there was one, once famously said,“I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts. And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.\"This is usually understood as commentary on technology, but I think it is more about capital. A less romantic framing, perhaps, than “economic potential energy,” capital is tools. Jobs’ point is just how potent software is as a form of capital. But ultimately all capital magnifies the desirability of the output of some exertion of time and energy. A bicycle is one example, and a computer is another. At the risk of mixing metaphors, capital is the bicycle of labor; of time, of effort, and of the grind to produce value by hand.Capital is tools.2. More things, cheaper things, new thingsWhat does money have to do with all this? The non-answer is to say that money is the most liquid form of capital, but that is to subscribe to a circular explanation. If by “liquid” we simply mean, “the time and difficulty required to transform something into money,” then money can be transformed into money in zero time and with zero difficulty, hence it must be maximally liquid. We have both stated and proven a tautology. The fiat economists would be proud*.I suggest we attempt to invert this understanding of liquidity. Instead of trying to capture how easily and quickly we can convert capital into money, what if what we meant was how easily and quickly we can convert money into capital?Okay, why? Is this even different or am I just playing with words?I think it is different because it forces us to think about what it is we really want; what we want is wealth. We want more things, cheaper things and new things. And we want the comfort and security of knowing we will be able to produce these things far into the future. We don’t want one more thing, one cheaper thing and one new thing – and we don’t even necessarily want any things right now. We want the potential to create more, cheaper and new.See also: The Blockchain Industry Must Build for the Real Needs of Real People Money does none of this. Money is not wealth. Money is a claim on wealth – money is liquid; it is salable. It is the maximally efficient way of communicating the relative value of things we really want. But it is only itself valuable because all these other things it helps us value either exist in the first place, or else could exist, pending our intentional, directed effort to allocate time and energy to bringing them into existence.Money is neither sufficient nor necessary for wealth. But capital arguably is. Real wealth is illiquid, and the liquidity of money is useful first and foremost because it makes it far easier and more efficient to allocate capital than otherwise.Another way of thinking about all this is that money is time. More specifically, money is time now. But capital is something different: capital is the cumulative product of having decided not to consume today but to make more, cheaper, and newer the future ability to consume. Capital is all time ever. I do not believe it is appropriate to propose that people should want only to consume in the future – that is none of my business. But we can approach the same issue more subtly: if you wanted to forego consumption and maximize your potential to later consume, could you? What are your incentives either way?To do our best to minimize the economics jargon once again, we might simply ask: what are you going to do with your time? Are you going to create or consume?And how do the characteristics of money, as the salable representation of that time, influence your decision? I sincerely believe that this is the killer app for Bitcoin: pricing capital. If there were ever a time to say that Bitcoin Fixes This, here it is.*Note, by the way, that a tautology cannot be an axiom, as it trivially implies all and only every other tautology as its theorems. Add one tautology to your axioms and you may as well add them all. Nothing is changed, and likely nothing is understood, either. Real axioms require some understanding of the subject matter under exploration.3. Stocks and flowsBut is this even broken? Can’t we price capital now?We can, but my goodness is it difficult! If you look at what has happened in capital markets over the last fifteen years, at least, this will become clearer and clearer.Until very recently I worked in this world. Indeed, it was the only (adult) job I have ever had besides this one. I enjoyed it greatly and am grateful for having the opportunity to study and learn as I did. In this role, I chipped in here and there teaching the new hires the basics of financial theory. What I dreamed up to teach them I was pitching at folks who I assumed were extremely intelligent but who had no experience of economics or finance. I found that an invaluable tool to explore this was by using the concepts of stocks and flows.Below is a cartoon version of a balance sheet and an income statement, in which I attempt to visually convey how the two evolve over time (see next page). In that pedagogical context, I was trying to explain as much from first principles as possible the difference between returns and what is commonly called “growth” but is really just an “increase.”(Allen Farrington/Axiom)All this is intended to represent the cycle of capital through a business. You get liquid, homogeneous capital (money), you transform it into illiquid, heterogeneous capital (productive assets), to create a product, keeping a little liquid to cover the costs of delivering the product; and if you profit, that means you get to go again and create even more capital, except that this time you get to fund it yourself.In the context of financial analysis, one of the key implications I intended to communicate with this principle is that the measure of success is not that the yellow number goes up, and it’s not even that the dark blue number goes up. It’s that the dark blue to purple ratio stays high. Because that is the only sustainable way that the orange number can go up. And this is where wealth comes from. Everything else here is valuable only insofar as it lets us do this efficiently.But, of course, in the world of quarterly, profit and loss (P&L) finance, nobody cares. They want the yellow number to go up at all costs – which might be a good thing, but it might not – and in particular they want the ratio of successive yellow numbers to go up. They call this ratio “growth,” even though it is really an “increase.” It is a dimensionless ratio of one flow to another. A real “growth rate” has the dimensions of one over time, like the ratio of profit over a period to its funding at the start of that period, or dark blue to purple above. The reader can hopefully see that what this ratio captures is the real, causal, time-dependent process by which the ability to produce grows.We want the potential to create more, cheaper and new.This misunderstanding – that we should care about short-term flows rather than long-term rates of return on stocks – I would say is basically the original sin of fiat finance and fiat economics. It is how you get the idea that, “we need to stimulate the economy”; it’s why you might think there is nothing wrong with gutting manufacturing capabilities and energy infrastructure because services are higher margin and “scale better”; it’s how you end up foaming at the mouth over “quarterly earnings,” as if any meaningful investment project could take three months and as if the measure of its success would be a flow and not a stock.It’s also how you get the idea that trading jpegs is productive, or that the product of capital accumulation should be artificial scarcity rather than abundance; not more and cheaper but capped and expensive. It’s how you think that if you create a simulacrum of wealth, at no cost, real wealth can somehow follow just because you have bootstrapped an idea. Not productive capacity: not the potential to create more, cheaper and new; but claims on wealth that you cross your fingers somebody else will actually work to create. And it’s how you end up with one of the greatest misallocations of capital in the history of venture capital and possibly in the history of capital markets.Real capital is scarce – precious, even. It is, after all, accumulated time. if it is going towards something stupid and short-termist, then it isn’t going towards anything intelligent and long-termist. If the money we use to decide how to allocate capital does not reflect this scarcity, we will think there is no cost to short-termism. The incentive here is not wealth, it’s just profit. It is not a stock, it’s just a flow. It is not to create tools, it’s just to dismantle them and trade the parts for fun.4. The point of profitThe reader might wonder if there is anything really wrong with that? Am I revealing a paternalistic pedantry of no clear relation to economics? Greed Is Good, right? What is the point of investing in the first place if it is not to profit? Isn’t profit a marker – nay, the marker – of entrepreneurial success and sustainable economic contribution?See also: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits Highest Level Since Bitcoin's 2021 HighAs a final tease, I would put forward that a far better contentious proverb to employ here than Gordon Gekko’s motto would be from the New Testament of the King James Bible, in which we are counseled that, the love of money is the root of all evil. Unfortunately, this is commonly misquoted as, money is the root of all evil, which does a dire disservice to the message. The two could hardly be more different. It would be a little odd for the general partner of a bitcoin-focused financial services firm to believe that money is the root of all evil, and yet I have a great deal of sympathy for 1 Timothy 6:10. I think it can even be a potent tool to distinguish not the technology but the cultures of Bitcoin and crypto, and Bitcoin and fiat.I believe it is completely backwards to think that the point of investing is profit. The point of profit is investing.Money means nothing without the capital, and the products of capital, that it prices. We like to think it means “our time,” which is true to an extent, but our time is not valuable in the slightest without the stocks of capital that multiply its productivity. Profit means nothing beyond the means to continue compounding capital in a truly independent manner. There is capital employed without profit, but there is no profit without capital employed. Moreover, profit is the informational signal that the way you are creating capital is valued by others. Profits are great, but returns are better.To ground this more in everyday experience: if you knew your money was going to be more valuable in the future, how would you invest?The logical approach would be to invest such that your return, while still compounding in value, would come as late as possible. You want your return as far in the future as it can be, partly because the later it comes the more value it will have compounded. But partly also because that is more efficient than constantly having to think of new projects, developing new skills, testing new markets and so on.This means that at a personal level, you are incentivized to develop skills as specific as possible, crystallize the value of these skills by creating capital as heterogeneous and illiquid as possible, and spend as much time as possible thinking about deepening these skills and crystallizing this value.But what if your money was going to be less valuable in the future? Well, all of that would be flipped. You would want your return as soon as possible and you’d want the optionality of new projects and new markets, which means you are incentivized to develop skills as general as possible and hold capital as liquid and homogeneous as possible.This would mean you are incentivized to stay on top of everything happening in the immediate term, to trade around it, and to spend little time – or no time – focusing on the long term. Any wealth you do own or that you can create, you really ought to financialize to increase its liquidity. Better yet, you ought to financialize somebody else’s wealth. Even better still, you ought to leverage somebody else’s financialized wealth – force others to leverage to compete, misallocate more capital or even start to consume it, create more money and ensure everybody’s money will be less valuable in the future – so we can start this merry-go-round all over again.In the latter, as long as you profit, everything is fine. In fact, if you have sufficient capability to financialize, you don’t even need profit now. You can promise endless future profits, “grow” (i.e., “increase”), sell the rights to them, and move on. Everything becomes reducible to its immediate flows. But as you gradually strip away your own and everybody else’s capital – as you dismantle, trade, and consume every tool – you will find returns to be more and more elusive and, eventually, impossible. The only important question becomes, who is holding the bag?Bitcoin fixes this. Bitcoin forces us to think first and foremost about the stock. It enables us to think far more clearly than we would otherwise about the potential to create more things, cheaper things, and new things. This is no mere thought experiment, it is happening around us, at a bewilderingly accelerating rate. It’s happening in mining, in the Lightning Network, in Nostr right now. And in the long run? We wouldn’t dare be so arrogant as to suggest what opportunities can be known. Properly incentivized, purposeful, acting humans are nothing if not creative, and Bitcoin is nothing if not an inducement to create …5. Bitcoin’s killer appWhilst it is technically correct to say, “Bitcoin mining secures the network,” I find this explanation to be dry. We might channel my earlier articulated appreciation of de Soto and observe there is a difference between a definition that is technically accurate and one that is rhetorically effective. The hash rate, after all, is a flow. I would argue a more imaginative conception of the global network of Bitcoin miners is as a distributed network of capital – a stock, and a tool – that earns a return which is contingent on energy efficiency, and so which incentivizes more energy, cheaper energy and new energy.More energy because Bitcoin pays for waste and for load balancing. This creates extra profit – not to be cackled over by fat cat executives but to be reinvested in heterogeneous capital to utilize yet more wasted energy and increase productive output. Cheaper energy because this reinvestment will enable efficiency gains, supplementing the returns of energy infrastructure, and will in turn lead to deflation as it is absorbed by the market. And new energy because Bitcoin makes it possible to exploit stranded resources with only an internet connection instead of costly transmission infrastructure.The Lightning Network may be explained in equally dry terms of “solving Bitcoin’s scalability.” And once again, this is not incorrect, but neither is it exciting. It is once again affirming that this has a technical purpose and is more than just a toy. But it is a purpose that focuses on flows rather than stocks. Instead, we might consider it a distributed network of heterogenous capital allocation that generates a return contingent on enabling payment efficiency. The consequence is more payments, cheaper payments, and new payments.More payments because fiat payment rails have counterparty risk, jurisdictional firewalls, and lower bounds on economically rational transferable value – all of which are absent in the Lightning Network. Cheaper payments because the network is robust, antifragile and decentralized, and every node operates as a kind of cellularly automatous market maker in liquidity, meaning routing is competitive and gross costs are driven down, as opposed to the network as a whole seeking to profit maximize by holding costs up. And new payments because all of this enables such innovations as “payment streaming” – very small payments at very short intervals so as to proxy a continuous flow – and programmable exchange – APIs for exchanging proprietary computational resources directly for bearer value in an automated manner rather than at the manual behest of a human.Nostr has often been characterized as a “Twitter alternative.” This is accurate enough in terms of the first use case to gain any major traction. But it is woefully unimaginative in terms of how widely Nostr could come to be utilized. Instead, we might consider it a distributed means of harnessing the Lightning Network to align the subjective economic valuation of data with the physical cost of the infrastructure facilitating its broadcast. The consequence is more communications, cheaper communications and new communications.See also: Nostr: A Decentralized Censorship-Resistant TwitterMore communications because the user experience of traditional online communication networks is subject to the design considerations of their operators, whereas the free and open-source nature of the Nostr protocol is such that anybody can build a client or integrate the protocol into an app to create whatever experience they want. Cheaper communications because, via Lightning, the signal of value is directly and bidirectionally expressed in the act of communicating between sender, router and receiver. Building services on Nostr is significantly cheaper than any prior alternative because the network is open and can be tapped into without first building a network effect, and its supporting infrastructure, from scratch. And from the users’ perspective, while legacy social networks are superficially “free,” the adage of, “if the service is free, the product is you,” is healthily absent in Nostr, enabling the ability to be paid for valuable contribution as well as to pay for what is valued, in a disintermediated fashion. And new communications because Nostr doesn’t rely on any centralized entity capable of shutting down politically inconvenient content.Let us contrast these heterogeneous, illiquid tools to what we have become used to under fiat. We get worse things and more expensive things, and although it is true that we get more things, one has to wonder what kind of thing such an intense pressure to consume drives us to produce more of. I’m not convinced it is worth it. If the source of “more” is pulling forward value from the future that we have no intention of repaying and allocating time towards this activity and away from experiments in the realm of the cheaper and the new, then it is not something I am inclined to celebrate. If the value we believe we have concocted is merely a securitization that makes more liquid a representation of the illiquid, but does not make anything illiquid, it is not something I am inclined to support. The farmer can always boost consumption by eating seed rather than planting it, or by selling that which he has not yet produced. One can always consume more if one is willing to consume capital. But I’d rather we create it.This is what we would expect to flourish from real capital accumulation. The potential for more things, cheaper things, and newer things that we can rely on if needed, but which we don’t need to consume. Of course, we still have scarce time with which to decide what kind of capital to create, and so the price of capital is critically important as well. I believe that the price of capital is Bitcoin’s killer app. Bitcoin fixes this.I think there is a plausible argument that this is axiomatically true. Capital is the weave in the fabric of economic life. If Bitcoin fixes capital, then Bitcoin truly does fix everything. Is this our axiom? For all X, Bitcoin fixes X? Is this the mystery of capital?Sure, but we can go further still. Bitcoin is not an end, but a means. Like all capital, it is a tool to serve humans, and to enable human flourishing. Above even its effect on capital we must hold at the front of our minds its effect on people. A tool does not wield itself. Nor does a business spontaneously emerge. A skilled technician wields a tool and an entrepreneur builds a business. To echo Kirzner, this is a perfectly competitive market. All it takes is an idea and the will to pursue it. Brains and guts. And so, we can echo de Soto once more as well, jettison technical jargon one final time, and end on a rhetorical flourish. We can trim our axiom even further and ask more simply: is Bitcoin not for all?Yes, it is. All we need now are the tools to get there.Let’s create them."

The effort led to an unsuccessful push by some EU lawmaker groups to add a measure to the bloc's landmark crypto law known as Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), limiting Bitcoin's (BTC) energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism in the bloc.Sweden increased taxes for data centers last year, also in a bid to squeeze out crypto miners.\"This is an industry that has not been regulated at all.

However, these announcements seem to have front-run an official statement from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which has not posted a list of approved issuers. Some of the posts have since been deleted. Singapore-based analytics company 10x Research said in a note there is a 100% probability that Hong Kong will not be the last jurisdiction to approve bitcoin ETFs, and more will likely follow. “This will be an additional demand driver for Bitcoin from various countries that could approve Spot ETFs, namely Australia, Japan, Korea, and the UK,” said the firm.Bitcoin gained on Monday, adding 3% after dropping to as low as $61,300 over the weekend. The weekend’s drop was due to geopolitical tensions, according to some analysts. Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia, said: “The weekend's price drop was attributed to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, with market sentiment improving after an announcement regarding a temporary halt in hostilities among the involved nations.” He also noted that the upcoming bitcoin halving, could trigger a short-term “sell the news” reaction before and after the event. An array of altcoins also gained on Monday, with Render (RNDR), a GPU marketplace that lets users contribute computational power to 3D rendering projects and earn tokens in return, jumping 19%. Ondo Finance’s ONDO also gained, climbing 18% over the past 24 hours.Germany’s largest state-backed lender, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW), is set to offer crypto custody services through a partnership with Austrian exchange platform Bitpanda. The two firms have entered into a strategic partnership, which would see LBBW provided with “Investment-as-a-Service” infrastructure to “store and procure cryptocurrencies,” including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). \"By offering crypto-asset custody, we are positioning ourselves with a clear added value for our corporate clients – while ensuring the highest security standards,\" Stefanie Münz, member of the LBBW board of directors responsible for finance, strategy and operations, said in a press statement. \"Bitpanda provides the necessary technical and regulatory infrastructure to offer our customers innovative and, above all, secure solutions in the area of digital assets.\"Chart of the DayThe chart shows bitcoin's 2% aggregated market depth, or combined value of buy and sell orders within a 2% price range of the market price, in BTC terms.The market depth has dropped to 6.76K BTC, the lowest in at least a year.Weak depth means the market may not absorb large buy/sell orders at stable prices.Source: KaikoTrending PostsUK to Issue New Crypto, Stablecoin Legislation by July, Minister SaysSticky Liquidity in DOGE and SHIB Suggests Meme Tokens Have Staying PowerBitcoin Halving Has Crypto Miners Racing for 'Epic Sat' Potentially Worth Millions"

That caused a market-wide decline as majors dropped as much as 18%.As a result, $2 billion in futures positions were liquidated over the weekend, the most since March. Over $1.5 billion of those positions were betting on higher prices, data from analysis tool Coinalyze shows.A Coinalyze representative told CoinDesk in an X message that the leverage flush caused open interest – or the number of unsettled futures contracts – to drop $13 billion since Friday, indicative of bets being closed.Some traders said the price fall was expected ahead of the halving, a much-anticipated event on April 20 that will cut the rewards offered to network miners by half.“While previous halving events have historically been followed by 9-12 months of uptrend, they have often triggered short-term 'sell the news' reactions before and after the event,” Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, told CoinDesk in an email.“This short-term bearish sentiment is also reflected in the net outflow of $85 million from Bitcoin Spot ETFs during the week, signaling increased profit-taking and investor caution following the strong uptrend in both Q4 2023 and Q1 2024,” Greco added, referring to bitcoin ETF products in the U.S.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Whales, however, are yet to buy the positive turnaround aggressively.Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock's \"large holder netflow\" indicator shows that addresses owning at least 0.1% of BTC's circulating supply have added just over 3,000 BTC ($198 million) today. That's significantly less than the net inflow of nearly 80,000 BTC ($5.3 billion) seen a day after March 20's dip below $61,000.According to IntoTheBlock, large wallets or whales are good at timing the market, often picking the best moments to accumulate or distribute coins. Thus, tracking the netflow indicator offers insights into what large traders are thinking and the sustainability of the ongoing trend.The lack of whale participation in the recovery means whales likely expect a deeper price slide. Bitcoin fell over 5% last week as the rally in the dollar index and Iran-Israel tensions triggered an outflow of money from risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies and into gold.Per IntoTheBlock, the netflow indicator is sensitive to wallets tied to U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and traders should closely watch the ETF flows on Monday.Bitcoin: large wallets netinflow vs price.

Based on the way Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto designed the system, bitcoin miners “find” the next block to hash to the blockchain every 10 minutes, meaning it should be easy to figure out precisely when the next halving should happen down to the minute.In practice, however, things are a bit messier.“Calculating the time to bitcoin halving has three important elements: The current block height, the block at which the next halving occurs and the average block time,” according to Simon Cousaert, director of data at The Block Research (which currently predicts the halving will fall in seven days, 15 hours and 40 minutes).“Since the second element, the target block, is a constant, the accuracy of the countdown depends on the current block height and the average block time,” he said. Likewise for counting the current block height, which should be easy data to fetch.Where the discrepancy likely comes in is how different halving calculators are counting the time between blocks. Again, theoretically the time to mine a block should be even 10 minutes, by design. But the amount of miners directing computational power to mine and secure the Bitcoin blockchain is not static, meaning that that figure can fluctuate.See also The Bitcoin Halving Really Is Different This Time | Opinion“The average block time is harder to estimate accurately,” Cousaert said. “One can take a simple constant, and assume that every block takes 10 minutes to be mined.” But what halving calculators are likely doing is taking “the rolling average block time” over some time scale, whether it’s over the past 100, 90 or 30 days (or any other arbitrary period of time).“This does not necessarily lead to a more accurate prediction, because the average of the last days does not necessarily predict the average for the next few days,” Cousaert added.NiceHash lead mining manager Marko Tarman echoed this point saying that everyone in the world has the same access to some “static” data regarding Bitcoin: the halving block height. However, there are two other “dynamic pieces of information,” the current block height and block time.“It's important to note that block times can fluctuate considerably,” Taman said. “If the average block times are shorter than 10 minutes, the predicted halving event will appear to be sooner. Conversely, if the average block times exceed 10 minutes, the halving event will seem to be delayed.”In other words, counting down to the halving — an event not only known in advance, but actively anticipated to the point that people argue over whether it is “priced in” — is more of an art than a science.“While this detail may not be critical when observing the countdown a year in advance, accuracy becomes increasingly important as the event approaches,” Tarman said."

BlackRock saw inflows of $192 million on Thursday, while outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) picked up again. Almost $125 million flowed out of GBTC on Thursday, according to on-chain data. Up to Thursday, the bitcoin ETFs had reported a total weekly outflow of $227.9 million. Some industry participants say continued outflows from GBTC put selling pressure on BTC and drive down prices while others have a wait-and-see approach, highlighting that outflows are to be expected from GBTC, given its higher fee structure.The stewards of the TON ecosystem formed a partnership with HashKey Group, the parent company of the Hong Kong-licensed crypto exchange of the same name. One of the aims of the partnership is to increase provision for Asia-Pacific users of messaging app Telegram's wallet to enter and leave the service with both fiat currencies and crypto. The TON blockchain started life as an in-house project by Telegram in 2018 and was abandoned two years later following legal action from the SEC. Members of the community then formed the TON Foundation to continue its development, with Telegram's endorsement.Recent news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating companies associated with the Ethereum Foundation is consistent with the view that there is no more than a 50% chance of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in May, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Thursday. The bank reiterated its view that approval of these products is unlikely next month, a position first expressed in January. The SEC must make final decisions on some ETF applications by May 23. The regulator approved spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January, stirring speculation in some quarters that versions for ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, may follow suit. “If there is no spot ether ETF approval in May, then we assume there is going to be litigation against the SEC after May,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.Chart of the DayThe chart shows prices for bitcoin, gold and the U.S. dollar index (DXY) since October.Bitcoin's rally has stalled since setting record highs above $73,000 in mid-March, while gold continues to clock new lifetime highs, brushing aside the resurgent DXY.Analysts remain confident of bitcoin's prospects as U.S. debt concerns will likely force the Fed to cut rates this year.Source: TradingViewTrending PostsBitcoin Cash Sends Bitcoin Traders Warning Sign About HalvingEther.Fi Inks $500M Restaking Deal With RedStone OraclesBitcoin Meme Coin PUPS Fuelled by Hype Ahead of Runes ReleaseEdited by Sheldon Reback."

This event, scheduled to happen every four years, has historically presaged multi-month bull runs.However, ahead of the pivotal event, bitcoin's (BTC) offshoot bitcoin cash (BCH) is flashing a warning, asking traders to reassess expectations for an immediate post-halving price rise.The rally in BCH, a cryptocurrency created in 2017 from the hard fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain, ran out of steam above $715 one day after its parent blockchain halved per block coin emission to 3.125 BCH on April 4. Since then, BCH's prices have declined 15% to $604, CoinDesk data show.The notional open interest or the dollar value locked in the number of active perpetual futures tied to BCH has collapsed 70% to $376 million in seven days, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the annualized perpetual funding rates across major exchanges turned negative early this week, indicating an unwinding of bullish bets. Negative funding rates mean perpetuals trade at a discount to the underlying asset's spot price.According to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute, BCH has been seen as a proxy for BTC's impending halving, meaning the leading cryptocurrency could face selling pressure after April 20.\"Over the last month, fast money has been seen in BCH - potentially trading the coin as a proxy for the upcoming Bitcoin halving; an interesting move in funding rates as perps currently trade under spot,\" Wintermute said in a weekly newsletter shared with CoinDesk.Several analysts have warned that BTC has already priced in the impending slowdown in the pace of supply expansion and could drop in a classic \"sell the news\" type move following the halving. Investment banking giant JPMorgan expects a sell-off to $42,000 once the halving hype subsides.Bitcoin changed hands at $70,700 at press time, representing a 67% year-to-date gain, CoinDesk data shows. Prices recently surpassed the 2021 peak, reaching fresh record highs above $73,000 well before halving. Historically, new highs have come months after halving.According to 10X Research, post-halving miner sales could make it more difficult for bulls to push prices higher in the upcoming summer months.\"Based on our calculations, miners will potentially liquidate $5 billion worth of BTC after the halving. The overhang from this selling could last four to six months, explaining why bitcoin might go sideways for the next few months – as it has done in the past,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, said.Bitcoin miners are entities that solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain in return for rewards paid in BTC.

The losses were short-lived, with prices rebounding early Thursday as the rate cut remains on the table, though delayed.\"The newly found 'Fed put' remains in place though, with the Fed focused on both risks to inflation and employment, rather than on inflation alone,\" trader and analyst Alex Kruger said on X. The \"Fed put\" is a notion that the central bank will come to the rescue if the economy or markets falter.Trader Christopher Newhouse said bitcoin options expiring after May will be affected more by the macroeconomic environment and organic demand than the halving.The large concentration of open interest in the $100,000 December expiry and the $200,000 March 2025 expiry calls shows expectations that macro factors would continue to act as a tailwind.As of writing, the December expiry call at $100,000 had a notional open interest of $226 million, while the open interest in the March expiry call at $200,000 was $70.7 million.Call at $100,000 is the most popular option in the December expiry.

Sonnenshein said the selling connected to settlements of bankrupt crypto companies like FTX is \"largely behind us,\" according to the report, citing an appearance on a Reuters podcast. When the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot bitcoin ETFs in January, Grayscale's product (GBTC), which had already existed for several years as a trust, experienced significant outflows as existing investors likely sold their shares to buy into one of the new funds. Another reason for the outflows was GBTC's comfortably higher fees compared to its competitors.

The pivotal event is set to reduce the per-block BTC emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.The drawdown in balance contrasts the steady accumulation of about 25,000 BTC in the five months leading up to the previous halving, which occurred on May 11, 2020.The change in strategy stems from bitcoin's recent rally to record highs above $73,000. The cryptocurrency has surged 63% this year, surpassing the previous cycle peak of around $69,000 well before the halving. Historically, new highs have come months after the halving.The rally has allowed miners to take profits at higher prices and fund equipment upgrades to prepare for the reduced rewards rate, according to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute.\"With miners' holdings still near an all-time high in USD terms ($124 billion), this sell-off appears to be a strategic move for profit-taking and operational upgrades, marking a behavioral change from the last cycle,\" Wintermute said in a weekly newsletter.The number of BTC held by miners has hit the lowest since November 2020. However, balance in USD terms is at record highs. (CoinMetrics, Wintermute) (CoinMetrics, Wintermute)The upgrades are evident from the rise in the hashrate, or the total computational power dedicated to mining and processing transactions, on the Bitcoin blockchain.The hashrate has increased by 45% to over 600 exahashes per second over five months, registering a more significant growth than the 15% increase seen ahead of the previous halving.\"The consistent rise in hashrate suggests that some of the miners are either adding or upgrading their equipment to mitigate the impact of the upcoming halving on revenues,\" Wintermute noted. \"This early investment reflects a positive future outlook and a strategic shift toward long-term operational resilience.\"11:49 UTC: Corrects second para to say the balance has dropped to lowest since early 2021.

The symmetrical triangle consolidation had ended with a bullish breakout early this week, opening doors for a rally to $80,000.Failed breakouts often result in short-term traders closing or reversing bullish bets in anticipation of a steeper price decline. Still, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, cautions investors against reading too much into Bitcoin’s bull failure.“Bitcoin’s failed breakout likely represents nervousness ahead of the U.S. CPI release. I would not write it off yet,” Thielen told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.BTC has fallen back into a triangular consolidation pattern. (TradingView) (TradingView)Thielen added that Wall Street’s tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, rose Tuesday, offering positive cues to bitcoin and other risk assets. In other words, bitcoin’s dip could be short-lived. The cryptocurrency closely follows trends in the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq-to-S&P 500 ratio.The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release March 2024 CPI data on Wednesday at 08:30 ET (12:30 UTC).The consensus is that the consumer price index, a measure of cost of living, has increased by 3.5% since March 2023, accelerating from February’s 3.2% annual inflation rate, according to economists polled by the Wall Street Journal. The monthly pace is forecast to have eased to 0.3% from February’s 0.4% rate.Similarly, the monthly pace in core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have slowed to 0.3% in March, following February’s 0.4% gain, equating to a 12-month decline to 3.7% from 3.8%.A resilient economy and labor market conditions have already forced markets to pare bets on the timing of the first Fed rate cut and the number of rate cuts this year. On Monday, the Fed funds futures showed expectations for 60 basis points of rate cuts this year, down significantly from 150 basis points in early January. The probability of the first 25 bps rate cut in June stood below 50%, down from nearly 60% before Friday’s upbeat nonfarm payrolls report.Thus, a hotter-than-expected CPI release may not inject a significant downside volatility in bitcoin. On the contrary, a soft print could put the June rate cut back on the table, reviving bullish sentiment in the leading cryptocurrency.“The market is already walking back expectations of rate cuts – the first cut coming in June is now down to a 50% probability, according to CME pricing. In other words, there could be some volatility, but it feels like the market is already more bearish on the inflation outlook,” Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in Tuesday’s edition.“Inflation unexpectedly dropping would most likely have a bigger impact on assets, including crypto, as it would signal that maybe the Fed does have an excuse to cut in June after all,” Acheson added.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

My analogy for non-crypto people is, would you want to fill your car at $50, you know, week after week, and then one week at $600? And that's effectively what high gas fees are on Ethereum,\" he said.Solana (SOL), often referred to as an Ethereum killer, is a layer 1 protocol with cheaper costs and faster transaction speeds than Ethereum. Layer 2s are separate blockchains that are built on top of layer 1 chains, such as Ethereum, to reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data that layer 1s face. Ethereum rollups and the Lightning network on Bitcoin are examples of layer 2s.With new solutions for lower and much more predictable transaction fees, developers can now build applications that are much more useful, which Jan Van Eck predicts will be more prominent going forward. \"The most interesting thing happening in crypto to me right now is that you have databases that can scale, that can take a lot of users of high uptime and now have predictable costs. And so real stuff can be built on these databases now,\" he said. \"We're going to see that in the next couple of years.\"He also said that its unlikely that ether ETFs will be approved by their May deadline, as unlike the bitcoin ETF approval process, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been not responsive to filings by the prospective issuers.\"We've filed our S1 and we haven't heard anything.

A trader on X said the token could be rallying due to positive ecosystem news. He said USDT on TON is expected to be announced at the Token 2049 conference in Dubai next week. The Ton Network was initially a spinoff from Telegram, with development starting as early as 2018. Telegram stopped work on the network in 2020 following legal action from the SEC, and several community members teamed up to run the project one year later. Bitcoin fell to $70,800, with traders expecting the price to range between $69,000 and $73,000. “Some liquidations will take place this week which shall test both resistance and support levels for a short term as we have seen this morning,” said Laurent Kssis, a crypto ETP specialist at CEC Capital.

The metric peaked above 70% with the debut of nearly a dozen spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in mid-January and has been falling ever since. Since late December, the percentage of the circulating supply that has not moved in at least two years has fallen to 54% from 57.4%. The decline likely represents profit-taking by investors who held coins for one year and over and marks a shift from the holding strategy seen through 2023.Filecoin liquid-staking platform STFIL said some of its team members are under investigation by the Chinese police. STFIL, which has just under $40 million total value locked (TVL) on its platform, said the core technical team is being investigated and that lawyers have been hired to provide assistance to the individuals, according to a post on X on Tuesday.

In March, the central bank increased short-term interest rates to 0-0.1% from minus 0.1%, the first increase in the rate for 17 years.\"The Company’s decision to incorporate Bitcoin into its treasury assets is driven by a multifaceted understanding of its potential as a hedge against inflation, a tool for macroeconomic resilience, and a basis for long-term capital appreciation,\" it wrote.The strategy also mimics that of Tysons Corner, Virginia-based MicroStrategy, the software developer that in 2020 said it would start building up its holdings of bitcoin.

In crypto, a correction is considered a price drop of at least 10%.Read More: Did Strong Bitcoin ETF Demand Kill Halving's Potential Bullish Rally?The bullish narrative stems from data showing bitcoin tends to chalk out stellar multimonth rallies in the months after the halving, an event that reduces the pace of supply expansion rate by 50% every four years. This time the halving will cut the per-block issuance to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.\"The narrative of the halving being positive for crypto prices is well entrenched,\" Hayes wrote. \"When most market participants agree on a certain outcome, the opposite usually occurs. That is why I believe Bitcoin and crypto prices in general will slump around the halving.\"Several analysts have argued that the supply slowdown is priced in and the market could correct following the event. Bitcoin has rallied over 65% this year, setting new records above $70,000 well before the halving.Tax payments to suck out liquidityHayes added that U.S. tax payments, due on April 15, coupled with the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening (QT) policies, could remove dollar liquidity from the market, leading to broad-based risk aversion and a fire sale of crypto assets around halving.\"Given that the halving occurs at a time when dollar liquidity is tighter than usual, it will add propellant to a raging firesale of crypto assets. The timing of the halving adds further weight to my decision to abstain from trading until May,\" Hayes said.Tax payments typically remove liquidity from the financial system as individuals withdraw cash from bank deposits and market funds to pay their dues.When the dollar's liquidity dries up, it appreciates against other fiat currencies, and borrowers with dollar-denominated loans face higher interest expenses and scale-back exposure to risk assets like cryptocurrencies and technology stocks. The dollar's weakening has the opposite impact. The U.S. dollar, a global reserve currency, plays an outsized role in global trade, non-bank borrowing, and international debt.Liquidity outflows due to impending tax payments could be sizeable, thanks to capital gains from the booming stock markets and interest income from elevated interest rates. In other words, the balance in the Treasury General Account (TGA) is set to rise sharply in the second half of April. The TGA is the government's operating account maintained at the Fed to collect tax revenue, customs duties, proceeds from securities sales and debt receipts and meet government expenses.\"When the Treasury receives tax payments, the TGA balance rises. I expect the TGA balance to swell well above the current ~$750 billion level as tax payments are processed on April 15th. This is dollar liquidity negative,\" Hayes said. \"The precarious period for risky assets is April 15th to May 1st.\"Hayes expects Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to run down the Treasury General Account after May 1, providing a bullish tailwind to risk assets in months leading up to the U.S. presidential election in November.\"After May 1st, the pace of QT declines, and Yellen gets busy cashing checks to jack up asset prices. If you are a trader looking for an opportune time to put on a cheeky short position, the month of April is the perfect time to do so. After May 1st, it’s back to regular programming … asset inflation sponsored by Fed and U.S. Treasury financial shenanigans,\" Hayes wrote.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Buying at $69,280 and setting a stop loss at $65,000 appears appropriate,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, said in a note sent to clients early Monday.The triangular consolidation has ended with a bullish breakout. (TradingView)The upside target of $80,000 equates to at least a 10% rise from the current price of $72,300.The breakout comes on the heels of a hotter-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report that highlighted the U.S. economic resilience, spurring risk-taking across all corners of the financial market.Bitcoin has been riding what can be described as an \"everything rally\" this year. Not only has the cryptocurrency soared to new highs, but so have traditional assets like Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, the broader S&P 500 and gold. The cryptocurrency's rally has been supported by persistent expansion in the supply of major stablecoins.In technical analysis, investors and analysts study price patterns to predict future trends in the asset. A symmetrical triangle, often called a coil, represents consolidation within a narrowing price range. The market typically builds energy during the consolidation, which is eventually unleashed in the direction in which the range is resolved. More often than not, symmetrical triangles end with a bullish breakout.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "Bitcoin's impending reward halving, though monumental, is unlikely to cause a volatility explosion, according to Amberdata's Greg Magadini.The impact of the Bitcoin blockchain's reward halving on miners and the BTC price has been well documented over the years, leaving little room for a surprising outcome.Bitcoin's fourth mining-reward halving is due on April 20, when the blockchain's code will reduce the per-block bitcoin (BTC) issuance to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.In the run-up, implied volatility (IV) on the largest cryptocurrency by market value has ticked higher, suggesting increased price turbulence in the days surrounding the quadrennial event. Still, one observer does not favor placing bullish bets on volatility.\"From a qualitative perspective, I continue to believe paying a volatility premium for a highly predictable outcome (the BTC halving) isn't worth a volatility event premium,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a newsletter on Monday.Traders typically place bullish bets on volatility ahead of binary events, for which the market outcome is uncertain. Moreover, uncertainty opens the door to pre- and post-event price turbulence and has traders buying both call and put options or volatility futures to profit from any price swings.But the impact of Bitcoin's reward halving on its native cryptocurrency and miners has been well documented. The cryptocurrency has historically produced stellar rallies in the 12-18 months following the halving.Read more: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedIt's important to note that major crypto events like Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, Shanghai upgrade, and spot BTC listings turned out to have little market impact, disappointing traders positioned for an event-led surge in price volatility.\"Not to mention that nearly all the big volatility events in crypto (ETH PoS merge, ETH Shanghai upgrade, BTC spot ETF decision) had disappointed IV [implied volatility], buyers when RV [realized volatility] failed to materialize by very large margins,\" Magadini noted.Bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility, which gauges the expected price turbulence over four weeks, has increased to an annualized 75% from 68% in a week, according to Amberdata.Meanwhile, the 30-day volatility risk premium (VRP), or the gap between 30-day implied and realized volatilities, has surpassed 10% for the first time since early March. The VRP tends to rise ahead of and following extraordinary market events and can drop to low levels during extended periods of calm markets.\"Options implied volatility is overpricing the event,\" Magadini said, noting the uptick in VRP.Bitcoin changed hands at $71,800 at press time, representing a 3.5% gain on the day.

The broad-based CoinDesk 20, an index of the most liquid tokens excluding stablecoins, was up 0.43%.When halving occurs, the reward for mining transactions is cut by 50%, reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus lowering the available new supply. This has historically preceded a bull market for the token.The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. Open interest on BTC-tracked futures has maintained record-high levels at above $25 billion for a few weeks, indicative of leveraged bets on more expected price volatility.Some Bitcoin ecosystem tokens and projects rose as traders expect a BTC rally following the halving event.

        "content": "It isn’t always clear how crypto is changing lives. The incorporality of blockchain ledgers, the fact that crypto wallets are online (not made of leather) and the limited number of real world use cases all contribute to the common view that crypto, at most, is silly internet money. But for as ethereal as Ethereum is, crypto does have an actual footprint.That idea is at the center of a new documentary about Bitcoin mining by Will Foxley, ex-CoinDesker turned independent crypto media mogul. Released today, “The Big Empty,” tells the story of when digital asset heavyweight Galaxy Digital descends on the small, rural and nearly hollowed out city of Spur (population: 863).Unlike many stories about bitcoin mining, which tend to focus on the industry’s intense energy footprint (and whether that is good or bad), “The Big Empty” is first and foremost about people. About the former East Coast Galaxy employees who moved to West Texas and learned to adjust, about the locals whose families settled in the area generations ago and about the lives changed by a new industry.In a way, Bitcoin mining was destined to become a controversial topic by the way the network was designed. The proof-of-work algorithm that keeps Bitcoin humming burns through energy without limit. Every year, it seems, more mines open — often using carbon-intensive sources of energy, sometimes even firing up defunct coal power plants.See also: The Honest Truth About Bitcoin Mining, Energy and the Environment But on the ground that debate seems muted, at least as the documentary presents it. The energy mix of miners and looming threat of climate change are as incorporeal and distant as Bitcoin itself. To the extent that Spur’s residents seem concerned about the giant Helios mine opening a few miles down the road, it’s often just because of the jobs it has been providing.“The small towns [bitcoin mines] inhabit often don't have many high paying or stable jobs,” Foxley told CoinDesk in an interview. “There may be a few retail shops, convenience stores, things like that, but it's not a lot.”To say that Galaxy is single handedly revitalizing the town of Spur might be overstating the case , but it seems incontrovertible that it has a presence. But as much as the doc highlights Galaxy’s good deeds (like reopening a beloved public pool), it is also a story about, as Foxley says, keeping that up and learning to be “a good neighbor,” which isn’t necessarily assured in the long haul.CoinDesk caught up with Foxley to talk about his latest documentary, what attracted him to the story of Spur in particular and why it is that a massive bitcoin mine might be a good fit for a city that was previously best known as a magnet for tiny homes.Just wanted to say it was a great doc, really well done. Are you planning to submit it to any festivals?It was definitely a very strong team, so I can’t take all the credit. This would be my third mining specific film and fourth bitcoin doc. It’s my longest by far — I personally call it my first short film. I don't know the difference between a short film or a documentary or mini doc. I'll probably submit it to some film festivals to try to get some more traction. Will definitely screen it at some bitcoin meetups and events If we try to do any sort of streaming services, we can't go the social media route. But if someone likes it, we might be able to place it somewhere cool.In some sense the story of bitcoin mining in the U.S. is the story of revitalization. Could you speak to what you’ve seen when touring bitcoin mines around the country?Bitcoin miners are flocking to small towns because that's often where there's excess energy from industries that have left or cheaper power from overbuilt substations and power stations. It’s a natural place for bitcoin miners to go because they have to chase cheap energy.The small towns they inhabit often don't have many high paying or stable jobs. They don't have any sort of industry at this point. There may be a few retail shops, convenience stores, things like that, but it's not a lot. To really revitalize a town you need some sort of industry.Bitcoin mining is interesting because there might not be that many jobs per bitcoin mine. But you create a lot of external jobs around that. In the film, you'll see there's tons of people who work in contracting and are in and out of the facility, truck drivers, repair technicians, people pouring concrete, security guards. Even just thinking about the facility, they plan on opening up a kitchen to feed the 40 workers there. That's going to be like five to 10 new jobs.Do you have a sense of what technicians are generally paid?Often it’s double minimum wage, $20-$30 bucks an hour for an intro technician. It scales up from there. One of the great pieces we didn't even get to fit in the doc is that Galaxy pays 20% above the rate for the town. Bitcoin mining is a slightly more lucrative industry. So they raised a lot of people's standards of living even doing a sort of blue collar level job.Was there something specific about Galaxy or Helios that attracted you to the story?Mostly just access. Galaxy was interested in opening up the doors. Corporations have to be mindful of their public image, (Galaxy is publicly traded), but I was impressed by how willing they were to work with a documentary film crew, because that's not always a very comfortable experience.The second thing — there's a lot of these Texas bitcoin mining stories that I’m not very interested in because people tend to focus on the energy or bitcoin side of things. I was really interested in the small town story, and participating in town life. Most people we talked to were immediately open to having a conversation or dialogue, which made it more attractive when we scoped it out last year.See also: How Bitcoin Mining Has Changed Since the Last HalvingThere was actually a tornado the day we landed that took out a large chunk of the neighboring town. One thing that was really interesting to see was how many people from all the surrounding towns drove out to help them out. There were miles of cars with supplies trying to get into that small town. It became pretty clear that the people who live in these towns in West Texas are just a different breed. They care about each other. They're good neighbors.You definitely get that sense watching the movie. Especially the scene with the tiny home community. What were you trying to say by including those scenes?So the initial name for the film actually was “Tiny Home Kingdom.” We were trying to riff on, like, tiny homes versus a mega bitcoin mine. It sounded good on paper. But you probably have to make the doc a little more silly to go that route. You know, live with someone in their tiny home for a week.The tiny homes showed how open Spur was in working and talking with other communities outside of what you'd find normally in the Texas panhandle. They opened their doors around 2015 to become a location for tiny homes. Many cities are zoned to block tiny homes, because they find it annoying or think it lowers property valuations. Spur was trying to find an angle to bring people back. It shows that they're interested in having new neighbors — it’s just that the next neighbor to move in happened to be an 800 megawatt bitcoin mine.Galaxy also struck a deal to reopen the town pool. Are these types of investments common for bitcoin mines?It's pretty common to have bitcoin mines do this. I've heard other stories where it's also been a town pool. I've heard about companies fixing the community rec center. The Riot team in Rockdale funds the local softball team. It’s because, again, when you move into a small town like this you have to become a good neighbor. You have to learn what that looks like, and as a corporation that can be kind of hard. It’s not like a lot of other tech or finance jobs; the business really runs out of one small rural town that has been the same way for generations. The easiest way to ingratiate yourself into the community is often by doing something practical.Another thing we didn't get to touch on is that Spur is a hotspot for drug issues, like a lot of low income places. We often think of drugs as being an urban problem. But it’s very much a rural problem. There's not a lot of hope and opportunity. A lot of people are born in Spur and move away to Lubbock or Austin or Dallas. And the people who are there sometimes can feel left behind. In some sense, the pool is a symbol: this big tech company cares about the local people.Did you talk to anyone concerned about noise pollution?Not for this site. That could be a challenge going forward because they are deploying some air units. But right now, the facility is all immersion — it's the largest immersion bitcoin mine to my knowledge in North America. The nice thing about immersion mining is it’s basically silent. And the mine itself is on its own little spot pretty far away from any housing development. About 10 miles away from the city Spur. And everything out there is at least a 20 minute drive. So there shouldn't be any noise complaints to my knowledge.See also: The Bitcoin Mining Debate Is Ignoring the People Most AffectedAny closing thoughts?I would like this film and other work we do to encourage people to think outside the box — about how towns can bring in businesses and about how these companies can add to communities. I think Galaxy did a really good job with that. They fulfilled their promise with this pool everyone's gonna be jumping and splashing around in. They even said that in the film, right? Like, if you're not splashing in the pool this summer, then Galaxy failed.I do think bitcoin mining is going to become a more important conversation for local communities. If bitcoin miners don't find a good way of balancing their businesses within small towns, there's going to be more problems. It's OK for small towns to say they don't like things."

        "content": "Bitcoin's upcoming halving might not have as much of an impact on the price of bitcoin as seen in previous cycles, experts predict.This is because the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already pushed bitcoin to new highs as pressure on supply strengthened.Nevertheless, the long-term effects on both the price of bitcoin and subsequently flows into the ETFs will be positive.Bitcoin's (BTC) halving - which is often seen as a bullish catalyst for the price - may not be as positive as the market thinks, thanks to the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETF).Halving, which occurs every four years, cuts bitcoin's supply growth by half, historically causing upward pressure on the price of the largest digital asset. The previous halving cycles pushed bitcoin to new highs, and this time, strong demand from the spot ETF may add even more fuel to the rally.“If we look at demand generally since the ETFs have launched, it has created tremendous supply shock already,” said Brian Dixon, CEO of investment firm Off the Chain Capital. “Once the halving occurs, and that supply is further reduced, it's only logical to think that the price will appreciate.”Read more: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedOn the surface, that may be the case as the demand from the funds has been significantly more than the 900 new BTC that are mined daily. And when that supply gets cut in half, it might create an even bigger pull on the prices.However, it might not play out the same way this time.The price of bitcoin had rallied 46% since Jan. 11, when the spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. The demand from these funds has been so strong that the price of the digital asset rallied to a new all-time high to keep up with the onslaught of bitcoin purchases. But the market may have gotten a bit ahead of itself in the hype.“This is the first time in which bitcoin broke its all-time highs before the halving, so there is a little bit of a concern that the ETFs have pulled demand forward and that maybe we're going to linger where we are for a little bit,\" said David Lawant, Head of Research at FalconX.Anthony Anderson, founder and CEO of Param Labs and Kiraverse, echoed this sentiment. \"Bitcoin ETFs preempted the impact of halving on supply by massively acquiring BTC since the beginning of the year.\"Also, halving might not affect the ETF flows either due to the already strong demand from the investors, at least not in the short term, according to Bloomberg Intelligence's ETF analyst James Seyffart.Read More: Bitcoin Could Slump Around Reward Halving Time, Arthur Hayes Says\"We know many miners use OTC desks to offload their BTC and the ETF issuers also use OTC desks to obtain their Bitcoin as flows come into the fund. So theoretically the potential halving of miner bitcoin sales could mean that ETF inflows will have a greater impact on the underlying market. But for the last few months the ETF inflows have vastly exceeded anything the miners provided from operations,\" he said.\"So if it does have an impact it’s unlikely to be anything extremely impactful in my view,\" Seyffart added.This is not to say that halving won't be a significant catalyst for bitcoin and the ETF flows in the long term. After all, the success of the ETFs seems to be closely correlated to the price of BTC and vice versa. The halving may even accentuate the appeal of bitcoin as an asset class to institutional investors. “I think the halving is going to be one of the best things for bitcoin since the ETFs launched,” said Bob Iacchino, co-founder of analytics firm Path Trading Partners. “At its core is an inflation protection mechanism and inflation is ramping back up.”In fact, the hype around halving might help bitcoin bring it in front of many investors looking for alternative assets to hedge against the global macro volatility.\"This [Halving] is happening at a time when folks are somewhat queasy about the risk that Bitcoin hedges against,\" said Lawant, pointing out that many investors are starting to pay more attention to how to protect their portfolio against any significant change in global economy and having spot ETF and an asset class with shrinking supply \"would be positive for ETF flows.\"This supply shortage might also lead to a longer-term impact on the ETF flows as it will impact bitcoin's \"marginal supply into perpetuity,\" said Seyffart. He added that, even though the impact of the marginal supply from ETF inflows in the first three months has been much higher than the halving can have, the slashing of the supply of BTC is \"permanent and goes into perpetuity.\"Whatever the case may be, the market may need to brace for volatile short-term trading for bitcoin and perhaps for the ETF flow after the halving, said Anderson, noting that in the long term, net flows for the funds should come in at a similar pace that is seen currently.Read more: Bitcoin’s Acceptance as 'Digital Gold' May Spur Demand From New Investors: CoinbaseEdited by Aoyon Ashraf."

Since its release, over $2 billion in USDe has been issued, with demand continuing to grow.Ethena Labs will start purchasing and shorting bitcoin (BTC) as part of a cash-and-carry trade in a move that developers say will create a “safer” USDe synthetic dollar product for users.The controversial platform is currently generating an annual yield of 37% (a seven-day rolling average that can change) by shorting ether (ETH) futures and pocketing funding rates since its January rollout.Funding rates are periodic payments either to traders that are long or short based on the difference between perpetual contract markets and spot prices.While such a strategy has attracted detractors, demand has continued to grow — as over $2 billion in USDe, its synthetic dollar, has been issued since its release. USDe is supposed to maintain a $1 peg at all times, mimicking a stablecoin but with a different backing mechanism.Developers say adding bitcoin to the mix will boost user yields while helping USDe issuance grow further.“After the unprecedented growth or USDe since launch, Ethena hedges represent ~20% of ETH open interest as of today,” Ethena developers said in an X post. “With $25bn of BTC open interest readily available for Ethena to delta hedge, the capacity for USDe to scale has increased >2.5x.”“BTC derivative markets are growing at a faster pace than ETH and offer better scalability and liquidity. As Ethena scales closer to $10bn this provides a more robust backing, and ultimately a safer product for users,” they added.How Ethena WorksOn Ethena, users can deposit stablecoins such as tether (USDT), frax (FRAX), dai (DAI), Curve USD (crvUSD) and mkUSD to receive Ethena’s USDe, which can then be staked. Unstaking takes seven days. The staked USDe tokens can be supplied to other DeFi platforms to earn additional yield.It uses a futures mechanism similar to a “cash and carry\" trade, in which a trader takes a long position in an asset while concurrently selling the underlying derivative. Such a trade, in theory, is directionally neutral and earns money from funding payouts instead of the underlying asset’s price movement.Here's how it works: First, someone mints USDe with some amount of money, say $10 million tether (USDT). Ethena then exchanges this USDT for BTC. However, because bitcoin’s value can swing wildly, there is a further step to stabilize the value of USDe.Ethena then shorts or bets again on $10 million worth of BTC perpetual futures contracts. If BTC's price drops by 20%, for example, the losses from holding BTC are balanced out by the gains from the short position in BTC perps, keeping the overall value stable.This combination of holding BTC while also shorting it effectively creates USDe. Plus, by shorting BTC, they earn a funding yield that is paid out to users.Ethena’s ENA tokens are down 8% in the past 24 hours, data shows, alongside a slight market selloff.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

The combined spot and derivatives trading volume increased 92.9% to a record $9.12 trillion.\"The spike in spot trading activity on centralized exchanges coincides with the growing excitement around Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs and the initial signs of returning retail participants in the market,\" CCData's monthly report said.Derivatives are often criticized for creating artifical demand and supply via leverage, injecting volatility into the market and are considered a proxy for speculative activity often observed at major market tops. As such, the decline in derivatives' share of the total market activity might be a good news for crypto bulls anticipating a continued price rally.Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, rose 16.6% in March, setting new record highs above $73,000, CoinDesk data show. Prices rose over 68% in the first quarter. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, jumped over 50% in the first three months.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "It was a day of positive divergence for crypto bulls as stocks tumbled late in the U.S. trading session while bitcoin (BTC) managed to erase most of the week's losses.In late afternoon action, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were each lower by nearly 1% – not a huge loss, but about a 2% reversal off of earlier session highs. Behind the moves lower were hawkish comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari.\"If we continue to see inflation moving sideways, then that would make me question whether we [need] to do those rate cuts at all,\" said Kashkari at a virtual event on LinkedIn. Kashkari has been among the more hawkish Fed members this cycle so his remarks shouldn't have been too unexpected, but stocks quickly reacted to the downside. His comments were also at odds with those yesterday from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who told an audience at Stanford that he continues to expect rate cuts at some point this year.Nevertheless, the rate outlook could come more clearly into focus on Friday with the release of the government's March employment data. To date, those hoping weakening jobs numbers might prompt the Fed to move more quickly to a rate cut cycle have been disappointed, with employment growth maintaining robust levels throughout 2023 and so far in 2024.Economist estimates are for 200,000 jobs to have been added in March, a strong number, though down from 275,000 in February. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.9%.Bitcoin, which had slipped as low as $65,000 overnight, rallied throughout much of the U.S. day, at one point topping $69,000. At press time, the crypto was trading at $68,750, up 4.5% over the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index was ahead 3.25% over the same period, with ether (ETH) a notable laggard, up just 1.75%."

It's since retraced to the current $67,600, giving bulls some hope that new records are imminent. At least one sentiment indicator, though, indicates that the price correction has more room to run.The so-called futures funding rate – payments to traders based on the difference between perpetual contract markets and spot prices – is around a record high level, reports CryptoQuant. \"Funding rates represent traders' sentiments in the perpetual swaps market and the amount is proportional to the number of contracts,\" the team explained. Positive funding rates indicate that long position traders are dominant and are willing to pay funding to short traders.Positive funding rates, CryptoQuant continued, suggest long traders – those betting on higher prices – are dominating the market and willing to pay funding to shorts, i.e. those betting on lower prices.The last time funding rates were this high was in April 2021. Bitcoin subsequently collapsed from above $60,000 to below $30,000 just three months later.Funding rate vs bitcoin price (CryptoQuant)Interestingly, the CryptoQuant report comes alongside recent data from the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showing record futures short positions from hedge funds and commodity trading advisors (CTAs).Read more: Hedge Funds Hold Record Bearish Bitcoin Bets, Data Show"

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesGalaxy Digital’s venture team has long invested its own money in crypto companies. Now, it’s planning to do that with outside investors’ capital, too. The investments giant is putting together a $100 million fund that will invest in early-stage crypto companies, according to an investor email shared with CoinDesk. Galaxy moved its venture capital franchise into its asset management business in 2023. The Galaxy Ventures Fund I fund aims to invest in as many as 30 startups over the next three years, with checks starting at $1 million. It will target financial applications, software infrastructure and protocols built on crypto, the email said. The new fund “will continue the success of our proprietary balance sheet investing but through a direct, institutional-grade fund,” the email said.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened the window for comments on three ether (ETH) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals. The ETF efforts tied to Grayscale Investments, Fidelity and Bitwise will be subject to a three-week comment period, according to notices posted Tuesday by the agency \"to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.\" Despite rising expectations after the agency's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in January, industry analysts have become less optimistic that the regulator will follow suit with products tracking the Ethereum blockchain's token. The commission had been pressured into abandoning its opposition to the bitcoin applications after a key loss in a court dispute with Grayscale, and SEC officials said the resulting approval of bitcoin ETFs doesn't apply to other tokens.Investment firm VanEck predicts Ethereum layer-2 (L2) networks could be valued at over $1 trillion by 2030 in a base-case scenario but remains “generally bearish” on the long-term prospects of several such networks. The firm evaluated 46 L2 networks across five key areas and predicted “thousands” of rollups will eventually emerge. Arbitrum is currently the biggest ecosystem, with over $18 billion in locked tokens, data shows, capturing the majority of $36 billion locked across 46 networks. VanEck analysts Patrick Bush and Matthew Sigel estimated that Ethereum will eventually capture 60% of the market share across all public blockchains. They modeled their estimate around the volume of assets within the Ethereum ecosystem.Chart of the DayThe chart shows annualized funding rates, or costs of holding long/short positions in perpetual futures, tied to the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market value.The recent bitcoin price pullback has normalized funding rates to between 10% and 20%.Rates spiked to 100% and above last month, signaling a build-up of excess bullish leverage.Source: Velo DataTrending PostsWormhole’s W Token Is Paying Out 999% a Week on Solana Protocol KaminoCrypto Market Maker GSR Recieves Singapore Crypto LicenseFrax Finance Expands to Cosmos Ecosystem Via Asset Issuance Chain Noble"

The token remains 80% below a lifetime peak of $3,700 set in December 2017.Bitcoin Cash’s block reward is now 3.125 BCH. Halving occurs when the reward for mining transactions is cut by 50%, reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus lowering the available new supply.Bitcoin’s own halving is expected on April 20, trackers show, and has historically preceded a bull market for the token. The previous halving, in 2020, spurred a 1,000% run to a then-record high of $69,000 roughly a year and a half later.Read more: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedOpen interest on BCH-tracked futures swelled to $700 million earlier this week from below $200 million in March, showing an increase in leveraged bets on more expected price volatility, as previously reported.Meanwhile, crypto markets remained little changed in the past 24 hours amid the lack of market-moving catalysts. Bitcoin traded at just above $66,300, up 0.3% in the past 24 hours, and the CoinDesk 20, a broad-based liquid index of major tokens, excluding stablecoins, was down 0.7%.Ether (ETH), BNB Chain’s BNB and Solana’s (SOL) were up 1%, while dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot’s DOT, XRP and Cardano’s ADA were down as much as 1.2%.Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email that the current lull was expected and traders were likely to be waiting for macroeconomic catalysts before making a move.“While Bitcoin's inability to rise is alarming, we saw a weaker dollar and stronger stock indices the day before, which is fuelling risk appetite,” Kuptsikevich said. “The cryptocurrency market's lagging performance can easily be attributed to accumulated overbought conditions and wariness ahead of the monthly labour market report,'’ which is due tomorrow.“At the same time, we regard the current weakness as consolidation within the bull market, almost excluding the risks of a long-term reversal,” he said.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

That's the most since the futures began trading in late 2017, according to CFTC figures published last week. CME's standard bitcoin futures contracts are sized at 5 BTC.A short futures position is a trading strategy in which a trader sells a futures contract to profit from or hedge against an expected drop in the underlying asset's price. Carry traders or arbitrageurs short futures while simultaneously buying the asset to safely pocket the price differential between the spot and futures market.The record buildup in short positions likely reflects hedge funds' renewed interest in the carry trade, according to Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research.\"There is a massive demand from hedge funds to put on carry trades. Despite bitcoin’s -10% decline from the all-time high, the futures premium has remained in double digits, and hedge funds are taking advantage of these high rates,\" Thielen told CoinDesk in an interview.Leveraged funds held record net shorts at the end of the first quarter. (CME QuickStrike) (CME QuickStrike)While bitcoin's bullish momentum stalled after hitting record highs above $73,500 in March, CME futures continue to trade at an annualized three-month premium of over 10%, according to Velo Data. In other words, carry trades still yield at least twice as much as the 10-year Treasury note, which offered a so-called risk-free return of 4.36% at press time.That said, some hedge funds may have taken outright bearish bets as recent robust U.S. economic data and hawkish comments from the Fed officials weakened the case for rapid-fire interest-rate cuts in the near term.On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the need to see how inflation evolves in the coming months, keeping the timing of the first-rate cut uncertain. Since the release of upbeat manufacturing data on Monday, the probability of the Fed cutting rates in June has dropped below 50%.In addition, some observers are skeptical that the impending mining reward halving will live up to its bullish reputation.Bitcoin's percentage gains after previous halvings. (Fairlead Strategies) (Fairlead Strategies)The Bitcoin blockchain's fourth mining reward halving, due later this month, reduces the per-block amount of BTC issued as a reward to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. Historically, bitcoin has chalked out major bull runs 12 to 18 months after halving, when the reduced per-block emission met demand.If past data is a guide, the path of least resistance is higher. However, according to David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, the small sample size makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions in a market fundamentally altered by the January debut of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.\"We believe that bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed with the advent of U.S. spot BTC ETFs,\" Duong said in a market update last month. \"Their multi-billion dollar net inflows in just two months have irrevocably altered the landscape. With major institutional players now capable of taking exposure through these vehicles, bitcoin's response to the upcoming halving may not necessarily mirror its performance in prior cycles.\"\"We think studies of previous cycles should be interpreted cautiously, as the small sample size makes it difficult to generalize patterns here,\" he said.The launch of spot ETFs brought lifted bitcoin to record highs ahead of the halving, as opposed to previous cycles. That has left the door open for a post-halving price drop.Analysts at JPMorgan foresee bitcoin falling to $42,000 after the halving hype subsides.

Dragged down by 10% declines in bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) the broader CoinDesk 20 Index is lower by 0.7%.Bitcoin managed two rallies to around the $66,500 level on Wednesday, one move coming a softer than expected report on March growth in the U.S. service industry and another coming after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he continued to expect rate cuts this year despite continued perkiness in both inflation and the economy.Most of bitcoin's rally in 2024 roughly came from mid-February to mid-March. It was during this time that the spot ETFs were regularly adding 5,000-13,000 bitcoin each day, even with sizable selling by Grayscale's GBTC. The action since, however, has seen big sales of bitcoin continuing at GBTC, while purchases into the other ETFs have slowed. On many days, net flows into the spot ETF group as a whole have turned negative.Alongside, the price of bitcoin has dipped about 10% from a record of nearly $73,500 hit on March 12.Macro factors figure inIn addition to the spot ETFs, another hoped-for catalyst this year was to be easier monetary policy from the Fed. Economic indicators, though, have crumpled much of that case.Inflation, which had been receding steadily for all of 2023, has actually turned higher in the first months of 2024. At 3.2% year-over-year in February, it remains well above the Fed's 2% target. Alongside, the economy appears to be continuing to steadily grow, with job additions of more than 200,000 each month so far this year and the unemployment rate remaining close to historic lows, according to government statistics.Earlier Wednesday, ADP reported private payroll growth of 184,000 during March, topping February's 155,000 and expectations for 148,000. The main event on jobs will be Friday morning's Nonfarm Payrolls report from the government, with economists expecting 200,000 additions.The strong data of late has sent the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield to its 2024 high 4.43% and the U.S. dollar to its strongest level since last November – both of which could tend to put a damper on risk asset prices, bitcoin included.Read more: Bitcoin Drops Over 5% as Upbeat U.S. Factory Data Powers Dollar Index to Nearly 5-Month High"

Increasingly it seems like the answer is “no.” As blockchain security firm CertiK pointed out in a recent report, nearly half of the $503 million lost in crypto security breaches this past quarter involved private key compromises.This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package and excerpted from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteTo be fair, this statistic is likely skewed by a few high profile instances. Namely, the $112.5 million hack of Ripple co-founder and executive chair Chris Larsen’s personal XRP wallets in January.There were fewer total key compromises (26 incidents) than rug pulls (34 incidents), though if counting phishing scams (83 incidents) — which is definitely a matter of users maintaining control over their coins — key management incidents account for a hefty majority of losses in Q1 2024.Of course, this is nothing new: people have been losing access to their “wallet.dat files” since the days of yore when Bitcoiners were able to mine BTC on their desktops. One poor soul has for years been fighting for permission to excavate a landfill in the U.K. after mistakenly tossing out a hard drive with 7,500 bitcoins.People lose access to their keys in attacks like SIM swaps and social engineering exploits; by forgetting their seed or pass phrases; sometimes hardware simply fails, be it hard drives or cold wallets; or things can be wiped in a natural disaster like a fire or flood, and yes, sometimes boating accidents happen.The point is, key management is an unsolved problem in crypto. This is why, as crypto has scaled to more and more users, there have been more and more custodial solutions that replace the challenges of proper key management — which is dangerous and difficult — with the familiar security solutions of using passwords to log into third party services.“There’s an overwhelming demand in the Bitcoin community that we must scale, we must scale, we must scale,” Craig Raw, founder of bitcoin desktop wallet Sparrow, said in a panel discussion at Adopting Bitcoin Arnhem 2024.A video recording of a four minute clip featuring Raw from the event has recently been making the rounds on Crypto Twitter in part because Raw convincingly lays out the tension between getting blockchains — specifically Bitcoin — into the hands of hundreds of millions of users and the challenges of maintaining decentralization.See also: Are Bitcoin Developers Losing Faith in Lightning? | Opinion“We have given up a lot of things in Bitcoin because of this demand to scale. And I'm just going to throw it out there that I don't necessarily think scaling is the be all and end all of everything that we should be thinking about,” he said.Notably, the only way for crypto to remain censorship-resistant is for people to maintain their own keys. There is an old idea in the Bitcoin community that “Uncle Jims” could run nodes for smaller groups of less technically-inclined people, an idea that has been increasingly diminished, Raw said.“It used to be like no debates around the fact that that's not your keys, not your coins. I'm seeing erosion in that term,” Raw said. “If you ask people today, what ‘Uncle Jim’ means, it's the guy who custodies bitcoin on behalf of the family unit. You see the difference between those two things?\"Gleb Zykov, chief technology officer of a HashEx Blockchain Security, noted in his company’s own report of Q1 hacks that “if anything, every incident shows the continuous and sophisticated nature of threats facing this industry,” suggesting the risks of self-custody will only get harder.I don’t have all the answers here, whether it’s possible to maintain the precepts of decentralization while also encouraging mass adoption. And neither, apparently, does Raw: “If you start to drop your ideals, you start to lose those things that make bitcoin unique.”It depends then on what you value.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."

ENA is currently trading at around $0.93, up 49% in the past 24 hours. The token began trading on April 2 at around $0.60. A number of cryptocurrency exchanges have listed the token, including the world’s largest, Binance. The price rally pushed the token’s market value up to $1.3 billion, ranking it in 67th place among other projects in terms of market capitalization. The project has also received positive attention from former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes on X. Hayes said he sees the price going up to $10.Bitcoin’s (BTC) steep rally has recently lost impetus. Still, the supply of stablecoins or dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, often considered a powder keg that could be used to fund token purchases, continues to rise, a sign of reassuring stability to bitcoin bulls. Bitcoin hit record highs above $73,500 on March 14 and has since struggled to keep gains above $70,000, mainly due to the dwindling probability of a Fed rate cut in June. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at $66,300, down 10% from its all-time high. Meantime, the cumulative supply of the top three stablecoins, tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and DAI (DAI) – which dominate the stablecoin market with over 90% share – increased by 2.1% to $141.42 billion, the highest since May 2022. The cumulative supply is up over $20 billion this year.The crypto-related venture capital (VC) firm Paradigm is looking to raise between $750 million and $850 million for a new fund, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg said if the deal is completed at the lower end of the range, it would still mark the industry's biggest since the recent crypto winter. Paradigm, founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia partner Matt Huan, previously raised $2.5 billion for a fund during the height of the bull run in November 2021.

Per Volmex, the two indices are analogous to Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX index, which is derived from the options market tied to the S&P 500 index.Starting April 3, Bitfinex users can trade bitcoin and ether volatility futures under the ticker symbols BVIVF0:USTFO and EVIVFO:USDTFO, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk. These contracts are denominated, margined, and settled in tether (USDT), the world’s largest dollar-pegged stablecoin.Perpetuals are futures contracts with no expiry and a funding rate mechanism that helps keep prices for perpetuals in sync with the underlying asset/index.The availability of volatility futures means Bitfinex users can bet on how fast the anticipated bullish or bearish price move in bitcoin and ether will happen. Being long volatility means betting the asset’s price might move violently in either direction.The volatility futures will help traders navigate binary events like crucial U.S. economic data releases, Fed rate decisions, and crypto-specific events that have the potential to inject volatility into the market and open doors to retail investors who lack the resources or expertise to set up complex options strategies like straddles and strangles to profit from changes in implied volatility.Bitfinex’s new offering comes a year after dominant crypto options exchange Deribit listed standard futures contracts tied to its proprietary bitcoin volatility index, DVOL.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

(TradingView) (TradingView)Over the years, stablecoins led by tether have emerged as the primary mechanism for purchasing cryptocurrencies in the spot market and trading derivatives. Since late 2021, traders have increasingly preferred crypto futures margined and settled in stablecoins than token-margined ones.Stablecoin-margined futures offer a linear payoff where the value of the collateral remains steady irrespective of market volatility. As such, traders do not have to constantly look for hedging their collateral.Other indicators like the Z-score of bitcoin’s market value-to-realized value (MVRV) ratio also indicate that the path of least resistance is on the higher side.The MVRV Z-score measures the market value’s deviation from the realized value. The latter approximates the value paid for all coins in existence by adding the market value of coins when they last moved on the blockchain and is considered a proxy for fair value.Historically, a below-zero MVRV Z-score ( has marked market bottoms, while a reading above seven has marked tops.

In 2022, for instance, bad code in Lightning Labs’ favored implementation, LND, prevented users from moving funds onto the mainnet for several hours. (Though to be fair, more often than not vulnerabilities are patched before they’re even exploited.)Other bitcoiners have raised concerns about Lightning’s many privacy issues and that the scaling solution often can be surprisingly expensive to use. In particular, they complain about the design of “inbound capacity” on Lightning, which limits the amount of BTC you can receive, so that users sometimes pay to receive funds (or, that payment is subsidized by startups).The latest round of Bitcoin Lightning discourse appears to have been kicked off by longtime bitcoiner John Carvalho, who was once one of Lightning’s biggest champions until he tried building software solutions on top of it. His recent interview with Vlad Costea caught the ear after Carvalho derided the “complexity and fragility” of the protocol.“Going through that experience has made me realize that the design is kind of a joke,” Carvalho said. “We can make it work. We can do our best, but all of the narratives that came with [Lightning] in the first couple years were really exaggerated.”Indeed, it seems like there is a turning tide in sentiment around Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which has been hyped as a potential replacement for Visa’s payment rails and the spur that will bring about “hyperbitcoinization.”Inspired by Carvalho’s interview, Bitcoin developer Paul Sztorc published a long list of Lightning Network “black pills,” including doubts that it could scale to onboard the global population of more than 8 billion people, the \"channel risk\" of who you interact with, the fail rate of payments, and that amount of bitcoin posted to it is a “microscopic 00.025%” of circulating bitcoins.Protos further noted the total amount of BTC on Lightning has been dwindling slowly, dipping below the 5,500 BTC level in December 2023 to about 4,750 BTC today. This might suggest that people are abandoning Lightning, though it’s worth noting the dollar value contributed to Lightning has doubled to about $320 million today versus $158 million this time last year.Just looking at the data paints a confusing picture: the number of Lightning nodes is also dipping down from a peak in 2022 as are the number of connections between nodes, and yet the total transaction count has reportedly been trailing up.See also: Bitcoin Lightning Exchange FixedFloat Sees 'Suspicious' Transactions Reading the subjective and anecdotal accounts collated by Sztorc, who has been advocating for an alternative way of scaling Bitcoin through “drivechains,” paints a more damning picture. All within the past year, highly respected Bitcoin Core developer BlueMatt called Lightning “a joke.” Lightning security researcher Antonie Riard left the project (publishing a highly critical blog). And FiatJaf, creator of the popular social network Nostr, spoke of his dwindling confidence.CoinDesk doesn’t pretend to have the answers here, though it would appear that, at best, Lightning’s growth is a bit static. But to say public perception has changed on Lightning would likely be to overstate the case; people have been saying for years that Lightning is overhyped and that its fanatics were setting unrealistic expectations.In fact, Lightning co-creators Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja said from the beginning that it would not solve all of Bitcoin’s scalability needs. There’s a reason why the meme around Lightning is that it’s always “18 months away.”While it’s hard to argue with critics that too much was promised for Lightning too fast (especially during the hype of the last bull market), it’s important to put the conversations in context. When the network officially launched in 2019, after years of testing, bitcoiners often warned that it was an “experimental” solution.Around the time of the first large scale test of the Lightning network — (the “Lightning torch” passed around the world to raise funds after Craig “Faketoshi” Wright sued the random bitcoin supporter Hodlonaut) — there was a trending hashtag warning users that it was #reckless to use Lightning, and to send only an amount you were willing to lose.See also: Craig Wright Was Finally Called Out in Court and Hodlonaut Is CelebratingThere were and still are legitimate complaints about the Lightning network, which should be aired if anything will be improved. It is difficult and expensive to open and close channels. There are numerous security and scalability issues. The custodial solutions that often make Lightning usable for everyday use reintroduce the problems of third parties Bitcoin was invented to solve.If there is any saving grace, it is this: When it comes to Bitcoin, often its biggest supporters are its best critics."

        "content": "In addition to price concerns, questions about network security in a post-halving world remain unanswered.There are potential security risks due to the possibility of smaller miners withdrawing from the market as rewards are halved, leading to reduced hash rates and overall security.It is estimated that 51% of the hashing power within the protocol architecture may be vulnerable to attacks.However, previous halving events have had minimal impact on overall network security, and many analysts predict a smooth transition for the network itself.The upcoming Bitcoin halving is the network’s most anticipated halving yet. The halving, a programmed reduction in the block reward miners receive for validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain, is set to significantly impact the bitcoin (BTC) mining industry.This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.Meltem Erdem is CoinDesk Turkey's cybersecurity columnist.The bitcoin mining industry is extremely competitive, with miners sometimes operating on razor thin margins. Scheduled to occur next month, around April 15, this halving will see the current reward of 6.25 bitcoins per block reduced to 3.125 bitcoins. What impact will this have on the mining industry?Is the mining industry well-positioned for reduced block rewards?The halving, which occurs approximately every four years, reduces the rate at which new bitcoins are created, thus enforcing scarcity and potentially driving up the cryptocurrency’s value. However, for miners, this means an immediate halving of revenue from mined blocks, assuming the price of bitcoin does not increase proportionately.This could lead to increased financial strain on less efficient mining operations, even forcing some out of business, which could cause a temporary contraction in the network’s hashing power.See also: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedThe reduced block reward also has implications for Bitcoin’s network security. The security of the Bitcoin network relies on a decentralized global network of miners competing to validate transactions and secure the blockchain. The mining process, which consumes substantial computational power, is incentivized by the block reward plus transaction fees. A reduction in the block reward means that, without a compensatory rise in bitcoin’s price or transaction fees, miners could earn less for their efforts, which might reduce the incentive to mine.If a large number of miners leave the network, it could substantially weaken network security, potentially making the network more vulnerable to attacks, at least in the short term, until difficulty adjustments occur.Are the security protocols for halving configured correctly?The reduction of the current block reward to 3.125 bitcoins from the current 6.25 bitcoins is a deflationary feature that contributes to bitcoin’s value proposition and scarcity. Though it also introduces challenges for miners.In the same way that mining pools and companies have added new machines in anticipation of the event, thereby speeding up the the creation of new blocks, the same could happen in reverse as miners power down if their revenues drop.If a significant number of miners turn off their machines due to reduced profitability, the total computational power securing the network, known as the hash rate, could decrease. A lower hash rate means the network is less secure and more vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as the 51% attack, where a bad actor could potentially gain control over the majority of the hash rate to manipulate the blockchain.Further, in a scenario where the hash rate drops significantly and miners prioritize high-fee transactions, the Bitcoin network could experience slower transaction processing times. This slowdown could impact the usability of Bitcoin, especially in cases where timely transaction settlement is critical.A significant and prolonged decrease in the hash rate is unlikely, as the Bitcoin protocol includes difficulty adjustments to ensure new blocks are produced approximately every 10 minutes. However, a lower hash rate could still temporarily increase the network’s vulnerability to attacks, potentially undermining trust in the Bitcoin network’s security, its price and adoption rate.It’s worth noting that, historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience in the face of halving events, with the price often increasing in the months following a halving, which can alleviate some of the potential negative impacts on miners. However, the dynamics around each halving can vary based on broader market conditions and technological factors, this halving is very different from the prior three.Can we expect any beneficial outcomes the mining industry?The best-case scenario for the mining industry following a Bitcoin halving centers around a series of positive outcomes that not only mitigate the challenges associated with reduced block rewards but also enhance the overall strength and resilience of the Bitcoin network. The most significant positive outcome would be a substantial increase in the price of bitcoin.See also: The Bitcoin Halving Really Is Different This TimeAs block rewards diminish, transaction fees will become a more significant part of miners’ revenue. The best-case scenario would see a balanced increase in transaction fees that compensates for the reduced block reward without deterring users due to high costs. This could occur through a combination of increased Bitcoin adoption, more transactions per block through efficiency improvements, new use case like Ordinals, and layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network driving Bitcoin’s utility and demand for on-chain settlement.Despite the reduced block reward, the hash rate remains stable or even increases due to higher Bitcoin prices and more efficient mining operations. Currently, Bitcoin’s hash rate has been reaching all time highs, which demonstrates that miners are not deterred by the upcoming block reward reduction. A stable or growing hash rate ensures the network’s security against attacks, maintaining trust in Bitcoin’s robustness as a decentralized financial system.Increased recognition of Bitcoin as a valuable digital asset by institutional investors could drive demand and stabilize the market. Institutional investment would not only support higher bitcoin prices but could also lead to more innovative financial products and services built around bitcoin, further integrating it into the global financial system. The recent launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. are one such example of the impact of institutional adoption on the demand for bitcoin.The Bitcoin network continues to grow in terms of security, adoption and technological innovation, reinforcing its position as the leading cryptocurrency. The mining industry, while preparing for the upcoming adjustment to the new economics post-halving, remains profitable and sustainable, driving further innovation and investment in the sector.Edited by Daniel Kuhn."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesBitcoin (BTC) faced selling pressure early Tuesday as the cryptocurrency’s reward halving approaches. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 5.7% to $65,742 in a bearish resolution of the recent week-long consolidation between $68,000 and $72,000. Bitcoin’s halving event is approaching this month, expected on April 21. The event reduces the pace of BTC production by 50%. Some analysts say the event has already been well telegraphed by the market, limiting any major reaction. “As we come into this halving event, bitcoin has just put in a fresh record high and could be less inclined to be wanting to extend its record run before first going through an overdue period of correction and consolidation,” said LMAX Digital in a morning note. The broader crypto market also nursed losses, with ether (ETH), Solana's SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) registering larger drops. The broader CoinDesk 20 index fell nearly 8%.Ethena Labs, the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that offers the $1.3 billion yield-earning USDe, has opened claims for its new governance token, ENA. In a post on X on Tuesday, Ethena invited holders of USDe to claim their share of the airdrop of 750 million ENA tokens – 5% of the total supply – which is set to list on centralized exchanges. Following the commencement of the airdrop, ENA rose over 8% to trade at around 64 cents, with a market cap of close to $500 million, according to data by CoinGecko.Deribit, the world’s leading crypto options exchange, said on Tuesday that its Dubai-based unit, Deribit FZE, has won a conditional virtual asset provider (VASP) license from the local regulator. The license allowing FZE to operate as a virtual asset exchange for spot and derivatives trading remains nonoperational until Deribit satisfies all remaining conditions and local requirements of Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), Deribit said in the press release.

Meanwhile, the broader CoinDesk 20 index fell nearly 8%.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, topped the 105 mark for the first time over four months, taking the four-week gain to 2.58%. A stronger dollar makes dollar-denominated assets like bitcoin and gold expensive, potentially leading to lower demand. Besides, sustained dollar strength is known to cause financial tightening worldwide, denting investors’ willingness to take risks.The Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI) released Monday showed that factory activity unexpectedly expanded in March, the first growth since September 2022.The PMI rose 2.5 points to 50.3 last month following February’s 47.8 reading. The headline figure crossed into expansion territory above 50, halting 16 straight months of contraction and weakening the case for Fed rate cuts. The new orders index also moved back into expansion territory and the prices index jumped to 55.8%, up 3.3 percentage points compared to the reading of 52.5% in February.According to Bloomberg, the amount of Fed rate cuts priced into swap contracts for this year has declined to less than 65 basis points following the manufacturing report. In other words, the market now expects the Fed to walk back on its forecast of three 25-basis point rate cuts for 2024. The probability the Fed will deliver the first rate cut in June has dropped below 50%.“Markets are focused on the ISM report, though, with 10Y Treasury yields up 10bp on the back of the return of manufacturing growth and higher inflation readings from the sector. There are 20 or so individual Federal Reserve speeches this week, and the market is likely thinking that today’s outcome will make officials wary of committing to significant policy easing,” analysts at ING said in a note to clients on Monday.Some analysts, however, believe the ballooning fiscal debt will eventually force the Fed to cut rates rapidly, offering a major bullish tailwind to crypto prices. The Fed raised rates from zero to 5.5% in 16 months to July 2023 to tame inflation. The so-called tightening was partly responsible for bitcoin’s 80% price crash in 2022.Looking ahead, bitcoin may remain volatile for some time as several job reports are lined up this week, including Friday’s nonfarm payrolls figure and the unemployment rate.

That’s the highest spread in at least a year, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko. Historical volatility indicates the degree of price turbulence observed over a specific period.The bitcoin-ether volatility spread flipped positive weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted nearly a dozen spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), allowing traders to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it.Since then, traders have been squarely focused on the activity in the spot ETFs, with net inflows breeding upside volatility in bitcoin and the broader crypto market. In the meantime, the dwindling probability of the SEC approving an ETH ETF by May seems to have demotivated ether traders.Bitcoin blockchain’s upcoming reward halving, a quadrennial event that reduces the pace of per block BTC emission by 50%, could be another reason for relatively higher volatility in the cryptocurrency.On April 21, the inbuilt code will reduce the per-block reward paid to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, halving the miner’s revenue, which, as per ByteTree, is currently at $26 billion annually.The spread between BTC and ETH's 30-day historical volatility indices widened to nearly 10 percentage points late last week. (Kaiko) (Kaiko)The consensus is that halving is bullish as it halves the pace of supply expansion, creating a demand-supply imbalance in favor of a price rise, assuming the demand side remains unchanged or strengthens. Bitcoin chalked out stellar rallies, setting new record highs over 12-18 months following the previous halvings, which occurred in November 2012, July 2016, and May 2020.What’s different this time is that bitcoin has surpassed the previous bull market peak of around $69,000 weeks ahead of the halving, which makes the upcoming event all the more exciting for traders.Per Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, the bullish positioning ahead of the halving means potential for a “sell-the-news\" pullback after the event.“The current positioning being so extended is setting the market up for a VERY interesting 'sell-the-news’ halving cycle play,” Magadini said in the weekly newsletter. “Should there be a real pullback, we stand to see excessive ∆1 [futures] OI become liquidated, volatility RR-skew to favor puts and a collapsing basis.”Magadini added that bitcoin’s options market has been pricing the halving event as well.“If we look at the options market, we see an interesting structure. A steep [IV] Contango before 4/26 and a high forward volatility kink for the 4/26 expiration. The options market is pricing in the halving event as well,” Magadini noted.The implied volatility, or IV, is the market’s guess of future realized volatility. Usually, plotting IVs for different durations or expiries produces an upward-sloping curve called a contango.A steep contango ahead of the April 26 expiry means the market is expecting elevated BTC volatility as it heads into the halving. The forward volatility suggests the same.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "With Bitcoin's halving event just around the corner, it certainly seems like we're on the cusp of something big. While everyone's eyes are glued to the skyrocketing bitcoin (BTC) price and the possibility of record-breaking highs, the ripple effects are far-reaching. They will touch every corner of the crypto market, and could even signal an end to crypto’s four-year bull/bear cycle.This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Daniel Polotsky is the founder of CoinFlip.Yet, it's not just about the numbers; it's about the potential for a seismic shift in how we perceive and interact with digital currency. Brace yourself — this could be the beginning of a whole new era for crypto.Bitcoin's ascendanceBitcoin's value has surged of late, buoyed by anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving event in April, alongside milestones like the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. and major financial institutions such as BlackRock publicly entering the space. This institutional interest has led to unprecedented demand, with bitcoin hitting a new all-time high above $73,000 on March 13. This was likely driven by record-breaking inflows into ETFs, including a $1.045 billion influx on March 12.This transition marks a more widespread acknowledgment of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset category, marking the onset of a new phase in institutional investment. It has also further bolstered Bitcoin's credibility and accessibility to retail investors.These landmark developments enable investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities associated with direct ownership. The increased liquidity and stability will likely continue to attract a broader range of investors, driving greater mainstream adoption and helping further fuel the current surge in bitcoin's valuation.See also: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Just the Beginning for Wall Street | OpinionThere are, of course, still bears out there. Yet, with projections ranging from $150,000 to $250,000 per coin, the bitcoin market is on the brink of a substantial inflow of institutional capital. This will signal a potential transformation in its historical cyclic dynamic that would drive new levels of growth and innovation across multiple digital asset sectors.Every silver lining has a touch of grayDespite the apparent bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market, several factors could disrupt this trajectory. Persistent inlation may prompt tighter monetary policies, affecting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Sluggish economic growth could also dent investor confidence, diverting attention from speculative investments.Another short-term concern lies in the bitcoin mining industry. The upcoming 2024 halving event is expected to trigger significant consolidation and defaults, as cash-strapped mining firms will struggle with slimmer profit margins and high operational expenses. This could force them to dump their bitcoin as they enter bankruptcy, which may keep the price down. Additionally, regulatory oversight and lack of funding pose challenges, potentially exerting downward pressure on prices.Uncertainty surrounding the 2024 elections adds yet another layer of unpredictability. Political outcomes could lead to varying regulatory changes, with potential shifts in the U.S. government's stance towards cryptocurrencies. While a Republican presidency may offer a more favorable regulatory environment, Democrats might become more receptive to the industry due to alignment with values like financial inclusivity and environmental sustainability. This may potentially foster bipartisan support for cryptocurrency regulation.The end of the crypto boom/bust cycle?Maybe most tantalizing of all could be the unanticipated secondary effects of the halving. While historically a driver of bullish cycles, the halving's impact may be overshadowed by the other factors mentioned above, such as staggering ETF net inflows. Total net inflows have surpassed $15 billion.The strategic intervention of institutions and retail ETF investors guided by more experienced financial advisors adept at “buying the dip,” looms large as a factor that could potentially dampen the halving's effectiveness in driving the market forward.This would mean the end of crypto’s typical four year bull/bear cycle, seemingly tied to the bitcoin halving, and instead suggest a trajectory of relatively stable upward growth, with ETF inflows emerging as the primary catalyst for crypto adoption. It's notable that this is the first time bitcoin's price has rocketed up before the halving, which in year's prior has preceded bitcoin bull runs.This shift could have profound effects across the industry. Initially, crypto's ethos was rooted in a countercultural resistance against centralized currencies and institutions with the mantra \"not your keys, not your coin.\" Now it seems the predominant force in crypto could soon be controlled by a handful of institutions, with ownership dispersed among individuals who lack access to their own keys — contrary to the original ideals of decentralization.A tilt towards institutional ownership could lead to something even bigger: the ownership of bitcoin by sovereign nations. More countries may follow El Salvador's lead and initiate a race to accumulate cryptocurrency, potentially initiating a global mainstream adoption super cycle.See also: Qatar's Sovereign Fund Might Be Buying BitcoinThis change might also lead to a departure from the intense boom-and-bust cycles traditionally associated with cryptocurrency markets, fostering a more stable environment for growth and development within the sector.While fewer retail investors will experience the euphoria of a bull market, the good news is that they will also be spared the brutal reality of buying at the peak and getting their face ripped off as the market plummets.This new stability could provide crypto companies and projects with the opportunity to focus on sustainable, long-term development, rather than timing market cycles and facing extreme headwinds during crypto winters.As investors and enthusiasts prepare for heightened volatility, it's evident that the market is on the brink of unprecedented growth and, potentially, a fundamental paradigm shift. While it is bittersweet, this upcoming period could be viewed as the end of cryptocurrency's infancy, marking a significant evolution in its history. Before saying goodbye, we should all be ready to celebrate its Last Dance."

        "content": "Investor interest in digital assets continues to grow. Crypto indices and funds are being created to track and provide tools and vehicles that expose investors to a broader cryptocurrency offering beyond just bitcoin. Jason Leibowitz from Hashnote provides an overview of evolving products in this market. Kim Greenberg from CoinDesk Indices answers questions in Ask an Expert.Links to SWIFT, BlackRock and the London Stock Exchange announcements about their plans are below in Keep Reading.Happy reading.–S.M.You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.Beyond Bitcoin: Navigating the Cryptocurrency LandscapeBitcoin, having recently commemorated its 15th anniversary, symbolizes a significant milestone in the evolution of the cryptocurrency asset class. While bitcoin laid the foundation for this market, the narrative has since expanded to include thousands of diverse tokens collectively valued in trillions of dollars. This growth underscores the dynamic evolution of the cryptocurrency ecosystem beyond bitcoin's pioneering role.As this asset class continues to burgeon, investors encounter a fundamental challenge: how to navigate the vast and varied landscape of cryptocurrencies effectively. While the allure of comprehensive exposure to the cryptocurrency market remains strong, achieving this goal presents hurdles around liquidity, wallet management, allocation weightings and ongoing portfolio maintenance through market cycles.The need to measure, invest and trade in the digital asset ecosystem extending beyond bitcoin is underscored by several factors:Diversification: While bitcoin remains the cryptocurrency pioneer, the market now boasts thousands of alternative digital assets. Investors seek exposure to a broader spectrum of cryptocurrencies, recognizing the importance of diversification in managing risk. With the recent introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US markets, investors are now looking for more diverse investments to add to their portfolios, including spot Ether (ETH), liquid-staked crypto assets like stETH, and other innovative crypto indexes.Evaluating Market Trends: The performance of the cryptocurrency market transcends bitcoin's fluctuations. Alternative cryptocurrencies exhibit diverse price movements, trends, and adoption rates. By tracking a comprehensive index, investors gain insights into overall market performance independent of bitcoin's influence. Investors are now keen on identifying the next big crypto trend beyond bitcoin's dominance, making broad-based crypto indexes essential tools for market analysis and investment decision-making.Assessing Investment Opportunities: With the growing popularity of staked crypto assets like stETH, investors are exploring new avenues for investment diversification, seeking opportunities beyond traditional cryptocurrencies. Broad-based benchmarks enable investors to evaluate sector-specific performance and identify promising investment opportunities within these niches.Technological Innovation: Rapid technological innovation characterizes the cryptocurrency landscape. Beyond Bitcoin, projects like Ethereum, Cardano and Solana pioneer groundbreaking solutions. Monitoring a comprehensive index facilitates awareness of emerging technologies and their adoption rates. As investors seek exposure to innovative projects and emerging technologies in the crypto space, indexes provide a curated selection of assets that reflect the evolving landscape of digital assets.Market Sentiment and Confidence: The performance of multiple cryptocurrencies reflects broader market sentiment and confidence in the crypto ecosystem. Fluctuations in index composition or performance signal shifts in investor sentiment, regulatory developments, or macroeconomic factors impacting the market. With increasing market maturity and regulatory clarity, investors are gaining confidence in the cryptocurrency market, driving demand for diversified investment options.The solution?Several firms are forming broad-based digital asset benchmarks. Just like equities have the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100, we are now seeing the emergence of the CoinDesk 20 and others. These indices are designed with trading and liquidity in mind.Ultimately, investments beyond bitcoin offer a holistic view of the cryptocurrency market. By providing investors with regulated access to a diversified portfolio of digital assets, investors can be empowered to navigate the evolving crypto landscape confidently, assess investment opportunities, and glean insights into broader market trends and sentiment. This approach streamlines the investment processes, offering investors a simplified avenue for exposure to a diversified and balanced portfolio of cryptocurrencies.- Jason Leibowitz MD, head of private wealth, HashnoteAsk an ExpertHow should I measure the ever-changing crypto landscape?As the new digital asset class emerges, market participants and observers will need a new reference index to measure performance, invest and trade. Similar to any asset class, benchmarks are used to capture the full market. Hence, broad-based indices will emerge as the reference for crypto and the new building block for investment products. Several broad-based digital asset indices already exist, including the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index and the CoinDesk 20 Index.Spot bitcoin ETFs have been approved. What’s next?Now that bitcoin is more traditionally accessible, we are observing investors turning their attention to the following three emerging themes:Broad digital asset benchmarks: Bitcoin's dominance hovers slightly over 50%. This means that if you use bitcoin to measure the market, you're not capturing half of it. Similar to other asset classes, investors are beginning to seek more diversified digital asset exposure through broad-based benchmarks to capture the wider crypto market.Bitcoin 2.0: Like other asset classes, there is a spectrum from beta to alpha-seeking strategies. Spot bitcoin ETFs are the beta. We are starting to see smart beta ETFs emerge, as we saw with the Global X ETF launch last week, as well as alpha-seeking strategies.Ethereum: The Ethereum network has several use cases. Ethereum's evolution from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake with “The Merge” established a native interest rate for staking ether (ETH). In traditional finance, interest rates underpin the largest markets in the world and serve as a fundamental pillar of economic activity. Staking rates can do the same for the crypto industry. CESR, the composite ether staking rate, is a standardized benchmark rate for staking. As we’re seeing interest in spot ether ETFs, I believe we’ll also see more about ether staking rates and total return solutions that capture ETH + staking.-  Kim Greenberg, head of marketing, CoinDesk IndicesKeep ReadingBlackRock’s next move into digital assets came with announcing its first tokenized fund built on Ethereum.Global money mover SWIFT announced plans for a new platform to connect central bank digital currencies within 24 months.London Stock Exchange expects bitcoin exchange-traded notes to start trading on the 28th of May.Edited by Bradley Keoun."

The market value of Treasury notes tokenized through public blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Stellar and others has crossed above $1 billion for the first time, data tracked by Tom Wan, an analyst at crypto firm 21.co, show. Tokenized Treasuries are digital representations of U.S. government bonds that can be traded as tokens on the blockchain. The market value has risen nearly 10-fold since January last year and 18% since traditional finance giant BlackRock announced Etheruem-based tokenized fund BUIDL on March 20.Bitcoin (BTC) prices were little changed over the past 24 hours after a volatile week. Prices briefly jumped above $71,000 on Tuesday, and have since retreated slightly to levels around $70,700 ahead of a major options expiry on Friday. Most major tokens posted slight losses. Meanwhile, bitcoin cash (BCH) zoomed 13% before an expected halving event on April 4. The current block reward of 6.25 BCH will be cut to 3.125 BCH. Open interest on BCH-tracked futures more than doubled to $500 million on Thursday from $213 million last week, showing an increase in levered bets on more expected price volatility.BlackRock's first tokenized asset fund is off to a strong start, garnering a significant market share of the blockchain-based tokenized U.S. Treasury market just a week after its debut. Blockchain data shows that BlackRock's BUIDL raked in $245 million of deposits as of Wednesday. Its strong introduction propelled the fund into second place among peers, trailing only Franklin Templeton's Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX), which has $360 million of deposits, according to rwa.xyz data.Chart of the DayThe chart shows shares in Nvidia (NVDA) are on track to register the first weekly loss of 2024.Since 2020, Bitcoin has closely tracked Nvidia prices.

Bitcoin options account for $9.5 billion or 62% of the total notional open interest due for settlement, while ether options comprise the rest.The $15 billion expiry is one of the largest in the exchange’s history, Deribit data show. The expiry will wipe out 40% and 43% of bitcoin and ether’s total notional open interest across maturities.Notional open interest refers to the dollar value of the number of active contracts at a given time. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC and one ETH. The exchange accounts for over 85% of the global crypto options market. A call option is a type of financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A put gives the right to sell.Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, said large amounts of options are set to expire in-the-money (ITM), which could inject upward pressure or volatility into the market.A call option expiring ITM has a strike price lower than the underlying asset’s going market rate. On expiry, the ITM call gives the purchaser the right to buy 1 BTC at the strike price (which is lower than the spot market rate), generating a profit. A put option expiring ITM has a strike price higher than the underlying asset’s going market rate.At the going market rate of around $70,000, bitcoin options worth $3.9 billion are set to expire in the money. That’s 41% of the total quarterly open interest of $9.5 billion due for settlement. Similarly, 15% of ETH’s total quarterly open interest of $5.7 billion is on track to expire in the money, as data from Deribit shows.“These levels are higher than usual, which can also be seen in the low max pain levels. The reason is, of course, the recent price rally. Higher levels of ITM expiries might lead to potential upward pressure or volatility in the underlying,” Strijers told CoinDesk.Bitcoin options: open interest by strike price (March 29 expiry). (Deribit) (Deribit)The maximum pain points for BTC and ETH's quarterly expiry are $50,000 and $2,600, respectively. The max pain is when option buyers stand to lose the most money. The theory is that option sellers (writers), usually institutions or traders with ample capital supply, look to pin prices near the maximum pain point to inflict maximum loss on option buyers.During the last bull market, bitcoin and ether consistently corrected lower in the direction of their respective max pain points only to resume the rally after the expiry.Similar dynamics could be at play, according to Strijers.“The market could see upward pressure as the expiry removes the lower max pain magnet,” Strijers explained.ETH options: open interest by strike price. (March 29 expiry). (Deribit) (Deribit)Dealer hedgingDavid Brickell, head of international distribution at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, said hedging activities of dealers or market makers could boost volatility.“The big impact, however, is [from] the gamma positioning of dealers into the event. Dealers are short some $50 million of gamma, with the majority focused at around the $70,000 strike. As we near the expiry, that gamma position gets larger and the forced hedging will exacerbate volatility around $70,000, providing for some whippy, choppy moves either side of the said level,” Brickell told CoinDesk.Gamma measures the movement of Delta, which gauges the option’s sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset’s price. In other words, gamma shows the amount of delta-hedging market makers need to do to keep their net exposure neutral as prices move. Market makers must maintain a market-neutral exposure while creating liquidity in order books and profiting from the bid-ask spread.When market makers are short gamma or holding short options positions, they buy high and sell low to hedge their books, potentially amplifying the price.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "Some Nigerians were shocked when crypto exchange Binance announced they would discontinue all services in Nigeria by March 8. Despite facing scrutiny from regulators before the announcement, many people still asked how the biggest exchange in crypto could just disappear from the world’s fastest growing market for bitcoin adoption. I wasn’t shocked because I’ve been predicting this for years. Entrepreneurs in the Global South are under attack and the frontline is a currency war being played out right before our eyes.This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the 4th Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Ray Youssef CEO of NoOnes.UnmuteI founded NoOnes, a peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform based in the Global South, because I foresaw the problems facing the crypto industry. Three years ago, I saw this day coming. I knew it was coming because I was the CEO of a Bitcoin company based in the United States, and I saw the financial apartheid and all the regulatory problems up close. American regulators hold Africans in such low regard they make rules to suit Westerners and don’t care too much about anyone else. I knew it would be more and more difficult to serve Africans and the rest of the Global South if my company was based in the U.S.My only option was to turn my back on my previous business, Paxful, which I had built into a Bitcoin P2P platform with over 10 million users. The problems I saw back then are exploding right now, but blaming governments alone is not the path forward. We must understand the pressures our leaders are under because only when we do that can we come to the table with them to forge a new path ahead. Right now, all we have is a bunch of people cursing each other and that is not the way forward.See also: As Bitcoin Platform Paxful Closes, Co-Founder Youssef Talks Alternatives This war is about the financial system and the power to control the levers that decide whose money is good and whose money is bad. Entrepreneurs in the Global South are trapped in their own markets, so that even making payments or doing business with countries next door is difficult. For the average African entrepreneur to scale any business by expanding outside the African continent, it is basically impossible. And now that Binance has left Nigeria, some businesses based here are wondering what’s next.To be able to truly unlock the potential for Global South entrepreneurs to create value, we have to nurture them and create an environment that allows them to flourish. That’s only possible if we do what I’ve been advocating for years: ensure there is free trade by having a free-flowing money system. Making it happen is not going to be easy.Binance was forced to leave Nigeria, and I’m sure it will happen to other crypto companies in other countries. It’s almost impossible to run a crypto business or a bitcoin marketplace serving Africa from another continent because you have to be on the ground to see the problems and find the solutions. I knew we couldn’t achieve our mission to help the unbanked if we didn’t have boots on the ground in the Global South, and that’s why we based NoOnes here right from the start.See also: Is Nigeria Strong-Arming Binance? | OpinionI’m not some mad guy who gave eight years of my life to a company and then left on a whim. I know Nigeria and I know the Global South because my businesses have been active here for years. We live and work here now, and we listen to what people on the ground tell us. We hired local employees to handle moderation for Africans, for example, and that’s partly what “boots on the ground” means.We are not looking at Africa — or any of the Global South where we operate — as a quick win. It’s about establishing long-term collaboration based on respect and equity. I’ve met thousands of tech-savvy Nigerian entrepreneurs and I know there is a reason for the high-level of bitcoin adoption here. For too long they have been stunted by an unfair global financial system, by financial apartheid that creates money prisons and stifles economic growth.Bitcoin gives those entrepreneurs the opportunity to show what they can do when markets are free and money is allowed to flow. All they need to grow is a level playing field. They just need a shot, a path towards success, a window of opportunity. Our next step is to make it easier for other entrepreneurs to take their business to the next level. Despite the withdrawal of Binance Nigeria, tons of opportunities remain. The battles we have to fight might be tough, but the opportunities on the fastest growing continent on the planet are worth it.See also: Lorraine Marcel: Bringing Bitcoin to African Women"

EVM is Ethereum’s native processing system that allows developers to create smart contracts. The name BOB is an acronym for \"Build on Bitcoin.\"Bringing Ethereum-style contracts to Bitcoin is seen as something of a sticky wicket due to concerns that the computations would place a strain on the network and degrade performance for other users.However, the spirit of developing atop Bitcoin received some fresh impetus last year through the BitVM proposal, as laid out in a whitepaper in October. Under BitVM, computations would be performed off-chain and then verified on-chain, similar to the mechanics of optimistic rollups on Ethereum, meaning there would be no risk of clogging up the network at other users' expense.Read More: Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Function 'OP_CAT' Dusted Off as Development Fervor Grows"

        "content": "As the world gets into a frenzy around the coming Bitcoin halving – and the price of bitcoin (BTC) as a result – it’s important to take a moment for a reality check.This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.David Bailey is chief marketing officer for Azteco. The halving is a non-event for the vast majority of the world. At its core, it’s a simple evolution in how much the people who process bitcoin transactions get paid. All electronic payments, whether made via credit card, Venmo or the tap of a phone, require some kind of processing.Bitcoin transactions are no exception.On-chain bitcoin transactions are processed by the vast network of so-called “miners,” who validate and record transactions on the blockchain. To date, these miners receive two types of rewards: a block reward, paid by the bitcoin network, and a network transaction fee, also paid in bitcoin by the person making the transaction.The coming “halving” reduces the first reward by half. There’s nothing surprising in this. Rather, the halving is a predetermined part of the system, designed to regulate the supply of new bitcoins in a predictable manner until the maximum of 21 million bitcoins have been issued. Sometime in the next century, given current trends, the block reward for processing bitcoin payments will halve until it goes toward zero.But the result of the decrease in the block reward has a substantial impact on the second, the network transaction fee. The increase in transaction fees is a stark reminder that the supply of bitcoin is, by design, limited. Once 21 million bitcoins have been issued (as block rewards), there’s no way for anyone to create more bitcoins or alter the supply, as governments often do with their own fiat currencies.This is why some people liken bitcoin to “digital gold.” It’s not a bad comparison but there are two important differences to remember: First, the supply of bitcoin is fixed at 21 million bitcoins. The supply of gold is finite, but it’s not fixed and known. After all, who knows what vast gold reserves might be discovered tomorrow?Second, bitcoin is infinitely divisible. As bitcoin gets more valuable, people will transact subdivisions of value (for example, there are 100 million satoshis in one bitcoin). Gold is physical and you can’t subdivide it infinitely as it gets more valuable, though new digital gold entrants are attempting to make gold act more like, well, bitcoin.The halving reminds people that the supply of bitcoin is truly limited and that demand is increasing, driving up the price of bitcoin in the long term. As something becomes more valuable, more people will want to use it, and so the cycle continues.In the near term, the largest everyday impact of the halving will be a broader consumer shift to processors with lower-cost transaction fees. Enter the Lightning Network, a second-layer network that bitcoin transactions outside of the main blockchain. The Lightning Network processes peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions almost instantaneously, just like on the main blockchain.The difference? The Lightning Network’s transaction fee is just a few cents. For regular people – those making small transfers or using a bit of bitcoin to purchase goods and services – this will become the preferred mode of transacting; it’s fast and it’s cheap. The relative ease of transacting with the Lightning Network may also accelerate consumer adoption.See also: Exploring Bitcoin's Lightning NetworkOn-chain transactions won’t go away, of course. People will continue to use the blockchain to document large transactions – the same way that you’d use a wire payment, not a debit card, to purchase a car or house.As on-chain network transaction fees continue to increase, network congestion will be offset by the shift to second-layer networks, which will in turn encourage a greater volume of transactions, some of which will happen on the main blockchain, which will push up processing fees. Ultimately, even with the rise of second-layer networks like Lightning, the net result will most likely be a steady increase in network fees as bitcoin becomes more widely adopted.And that’s a good thing.The more bitcoin acts like other currencies, the more comfortable people will be using it. While most of us are not miners, many of us are currently financially disenfranchised: Today there are more than a billion adults in the world who have a smartphone but no bank account. These people are digitally connected to the rest of the world, but lack the benefits of participating in a global financial system.For them, bitcoin is a strong solution for their daily spending or personal savings – but only if it’s fast, reliable, inexpensive and accessible. The halving, by spurring the adoption of second-layer networks like Lightning, makes bitcoin just that."

That wallet showed just under 5,690 BTC, significantly more than what public trackers of El Salvador's holdings had estimated.The trackers were off because in addition to the country's long-standing policy of purchasing one bitcoin per day, El Salvador was also adding tokens via the sale of passports, currency conversions from businesses, and from mining and government services.Consistently positioning itself as a bitcoin-friendly nation, El Salvador also this month eliminated income tax on money coming into the country from abroad, making it an attractive destination for foreign investment and bitcoin enthusiasts.The nation also introduced a law in December granting citizenship to bitcoin investors who make a donation to the government.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

The stock exchange will accept applications for trading crypto ETNs starting on April 8. The market will be subject to the approval of the U.K. regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, the notice said. ETNs are similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in that they are designed to mirror investments tracked by an index or benchmark. They differ because an ETN functions more like a bond. They are unsecured debt notes. The FCA said earlier in March that it would not turn down requests from recognized investment exchanges to create a listed market segment for ETNs. The products will be available to professional investors only.The Nasdaq-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs registered inflows totaling $15.4 million on Monday, ending a five-day run of outflows, according to provisional data published by investment firm Farside.

Other funds like BITB, BTCO, EZBC, and BRRR received between $11 million and $20 million each. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s ETF (GBTC) continued to bleed money, losing just over $350 million.

These ETFs invest directly in bitcoin and eliminate the need to rollover positions, a key feature of futures-based ETFs that went live in October 2021.Since the spot ETFs began trading, bitcoin has risen over 50% to $70,750. On Monday, prices rose just over 4%, briefly topping the $71,000 mark.Spot ETFs accumulated a total of $15.4 million on Monday. (Farside) (Farside)Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said quarter-end flows could be stronger than usual, lifting the cryptocurrency’s price to new highs.“Bitcoin ETF flows turned around magically on Monday as Fidelity suddenly found $262m of buyers, compared to $18m, $3m, and $13m during the previous three sessions. Flows on Tuesday (30%) tend to cannibalize flows from Thursday (16%) and Friday (12%), while Monday and Wednesday (each 21%) see their fair ‘20%’ share per weekday,\" Thielen said Tuesday’s edition of the newsletter.“With bitcoin above $70,000, we can imagine that flows on Tuesday could also be positive again. With the quarter end, flows might be stronger than usual,” Thielen added.Thielen stressed that spot ETF inflows and issuance of dollar-pegged stablecoin tether (USDT) need to pick up for bitcoin to chart another aggressive move higher, or else the burden of the rally would fall on futures traders’ shoulders. Tether, the world’s largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, is widely used as a funding currency in the crypto spot and derivatives markets.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Near Protocol’s NEAR and Internet Computer’s ICP jumped over 10% to post the most gains among alternative tokens.Projects linked to Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the prominent crypto exchange, recorded the most gains as a category with an average 10% bump. Such gains came as sentiment and on-chain activity on the closely related Base blockchain grew over the weekend.The broader CoinDesk 20, an index of the biggest tokens minus stablecoins, rose 4.47%. Data shows that open interest in crypto-tracked futures jumped nearly 8%, indicative of money flowing into the market—which usually precedes volatility.Open interest bumped over the past 24 hours. (Coinglass)The rise helped erase losses from last week amid record outflows from the Grayscale bitcoin ETF (GBTC). Inflows to other bitcoin ETFs dropped in tandem, giving rise to concerns of a spot-driven selloff.Some market analysts said the waning inflows were not a sign of concern, however, as long-term investors could have partially profited from their positions.“We also do not see the state of inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs as any cause for concern,” Bitfinex analysts said in an email “Even though negative ETF outflows featured heavily last week, all of it is from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), as investors both switch out of the higher fees demanded by GBTC and also take profit, especially as many of these investors are long-term holders who entered during the bear market.”“GBTC investors are not the only sellers in the market. Whale wallet activities have also indicated significant profit taking,” they added.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "I. He was a crookIn May 2021, I interviewed Sam Bankman-Fried and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez together as part of a virtual crypto summit. Miami had gone all in becoming a crypto-friendly city, and the hallmark of that push was the Miami Heat making FTX its “official and exclusive cryptocurrency exchange partner,” a sponsorship that included stadium naming rights and was reportedly worth $135 million over 19 years.This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Daniel Roberts is the former editor in chief of Decrypt, and before that spent more than five years at Yahoo Finance and more than five years at Fortune.UnmuteIt was the length of the deal that befuddled me: How could a company that had only existed for two years (FTX launched in May 2019) sign a 19-year basketball stadium naming rights commitment? How could the National Basketball Association, famously cautious about its corporate partners, feel confident this crypto exchange that appeared out of nowhere would still be around in 2040?I asked SBF. He grinned and said, “It's a good question. Without going into the details, it's been a pretty good year for us. To the point where, frankly, we don't need to rely on the other 18 years to have the funds for this.” They could pay the full contract upfront, was his point. I couldn’t argue with that, and didn’t. I smiled like an idiot and moved on; what else was there to say? As we all know, FTX filed for bankruptcy just 18 months later.The company’s rise always felt unsettling; its ascendancy caused some unspoken vertigo. For those of us who had been covering the industry for years, we had long known the major companies extremely well: Coinbase, DCG, Grayscale, Gemini, Circle, to name a few. FTX appeared out of thin air, founded by a supposed whiz kid trader from Jane Street.Even saying that it launched in 2019 doesn’t adequately convey how sudden its arrival was: no one was talking about FTX until 2021, when, at peak crypto market mania, it raised $1.8 billion from venture capitalists, rabid with FOMO, at outlandish pace: $1 billion in July 2021 (Series B), then $420.69 million in October 2021 (we should have known from that choice of number it was not a real company), then $400 million in January 2022; not to mention another $400 million for the “separate” FTX.US business the same month. That’s $2.2 billion raised in six months.I would interview SBF twice more, in January and August 2022. I was in the Bahamas in April 2022 at the circus-like FTX confab in partnership with Anthony Scaramucci’s SALT conference. It’s difficult to convey how surreal that event was. Andrew Yang and Katy Perry showed up to party and meet Sam. Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen were all speakers, but their onstage panels were strictly “off the record,” a ridiculous condition (at an otherwise fully on-the-record conference) that no journalists present should have respected — and yet we all did.Through it all, I and many others in crypto media had the sense that something here was very wrong. That’s not to say we called it or caught it. I’m not in the camp that blames the media for SBF’s celebrity (mostly he bought his stardom with marketing). But I do think we all shared the same vague feeling of dread when legacy magazine covers crowned him “the next Warren Buffett.”See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto? | OpinionEven after the collapse of the exchange, when SBF was first arrested and charged, my opinion was that he was not a conscious criminal, but that he got in way over his head and didn’t have the wherewithal to manage the situation. That was not to excuse him or the unconscionably bad management of a company that held billions in customer funds, but my presumption was incompetence more than Madoff-level malicious intent.The document that prosecutors appended last week to back up their demand for a 40-50 year sentence puts an end to any remaining delusions. It is a document so transparently venal that it reveals SBF to be a person with no beliefs, no convictions, nothing but vacuous greed.His list of “ideas” to save his image included: go on Tucker Carlson to “come out as a Republican” (after donating millions to Democrats in 2022) and “come out against the woke agenda”; blame FTX’s lawyers and/or lawyers in general for “throwing entrepreneurs under the bus”; blame the people handling the Chapter 11 process and say they’re standing in the way of customers getting their money back; praise the people handling the Chapter 11 process and say that thanks to them, customers will get their money back; blame Alameda (his hedge fund that was using FTX as its piggy bank); do an interview on ABC with his biographer Michael Lewis; or “send out a Twitter poll asking people what to do.”It’s the biggest news event to ever happen in the crypto industry, and it was extremely deleterious to the image of what was supposed to be a revolutionary technology ...I’m almost surprised not to see “blame my parents” on the list. The environmentalism was a front. The effective altruism was a front. Advocating for crypto in Washington was a front. He believes in nothing. To quote Hunter S. Thompson’s immortal obituary of Dick Nixon, \"he was a crook.\" He was the most insidious crook the cryptocurrency industry has ever had, which is saying a lot, and he did more damage to the public perception of crypto than any other individual, and it isn’t close.And yet. Bitcoin (BTC) soared to new all-time-highs just 15 months after the highest-profile black eye the crypto industry has ever seen. That is remarkable, and it’s something that, it seems to me, the broader mainstream media has been mostly uninterested in covering.II. Narrative gazingI first wrote about Bitcoin in 2011 for Fortune.com, and ever since have been most fascinated by the reputation and public perception of Bitcoin and crypto culture.The news peg for my story was that Gawker (R.I.P.) had just run a great exposé about Silk Road (quite a headline: \"The Underground Website Where You Can Buy Any Drug Imaginable\") and as part of it, explained that the currency of Silk Road was bitcoin, which was “purportedly untraceable.” (Not quite right, but describing the tech precisely right was not always easy at the time.) The Gawker story prompted Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer (NY) and Joe Manchin (WV) to write Attorney General Eric Holder a letter demanding a crackdown on Silk Road and bitcoin, which they called “a form of money laundering.”There weren’t many journalists covering cryptocurrency at that time. All of us in this small, weird pond have seen many market cycles and accompanying narratives, and it seems to me that, after 15 years, not much has changed.The first big bitcoin bull run was in 2013, when it first topped $1,000, then tanked after the collapse of early exchange Mt Gox. But it was still relatively obscure until the 2017 rally that made it a topic of conversation at the Thanksgiving dinner table that year, when crypto truly broke into the mainstream consciousness. Legacy media orgs assigned full-time beat reporters to cover this opaque fintech topic that was gaining interest from normies, fueled by the initial coin offering (ICO) boom (paging Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled, Kim Kardashian and the many other celebs that hawked token sales). Then another crash.Then came the pandemic rally, in 2021, when crypto mania truly set in, inextricably tied up with the retail investor revolution, WallStreetBets and GameStop, stonks, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and memes. Investing became a public social activity for the very-online. Then another crash. And now the current rally, in which bitcoin has soared above $72,000, driven by the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) and institutional adoption from big suits like BlackRock and Fidelity. Of course, with crypto it’s never just one thing driving it, and the current rally is not just about the ETF, but I suspect it will be most easily remembered and characterized that way.Through it all, entrepreneurs have built legitimate companies, and picks-and-shovels tools and services, that form the backbone of a bustling tech category. But among the general public, the narratives have gone something like this, with little change over 15 years: bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme or vaguely scammy, a tool mostly used by hackers and fraudsters. Or it’s killing the environment by gobbling up electricity. Or at best, it is unserious. It annoys people. It annoyed them well before FTX rose and fell. Remember all the Super Bowl ads? Matt Damon saying “fortune favors the brave”? Bros with their “HODL” shirts and Lambos? Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton holding up cutouts of their Bored Apes on primetime television?See also: If You're in Crypto, You're a Criminal | OpinionBut FTX took things to a new level with massive billboards of Bankman-Fried and Bundchen, an FTX patch on every baseball umpire’s shirt, an FTX logo on race cars and NBA arenas. It marketed so aggressively that it wormed its way into the public’s consciousness — and then it went under. It’s the biggest news event to ever happen in the crypto industry, and it was extremely deleterious to the image of what was supposed to be a revolutionary technology, a new payment rails, not a cultural lightning rod.And it took just 15 months to return to all-time-highs.As for mainstream media, and broadcast news in particular, they mostly only cover it when the price is surging or tanking. That has been true since the 2017 run, and with some exceptions here and there, it’s still true today. And now, in the midst of a new bull run, they seem less interested than ever. The defining forces are major financial institutions rather than Elon Musk pumping dogecoin (DOGE) on SNL. Sure, memecoins with names like BONK and dogwifhat (WIF) and Jeo Boden have pumped too, but for the most part, the 2024 bull run lacks the carnival barkers.Perhaps this is a positive indicator. Perhaps — call this spin if you must — crypto is less of an oddity than ever before. Perhaps crypto is finally growing up.Edited by Daniel Kuhn and Benjamin Schiller."

Ethereum's ether (ETH) was up 6% during the same period, while tokens for major layer-1 blockchains Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) advanced more than 10%.The rally extended to virtually all digital assets, with all constituents of the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) being in the green and the gauge up 6.1% for the day.The sudden resurgence liquidated $195 million of leveraged derivatives positions across all crypto assets, some $129 million of them being short positions seeking to profit from lower prices, CoinGlass data shows. Bitcoin short liquidations reached $53 million, less than the average daily figure of the recent period.BTC liquidations (CoinGlass)The relatively modest amount of short liquidations despite the price surge suggests there weren't many market participants using leverage to bet on continued weakness.Bitcoin targets $83,000 and higher after breaking out from consolidation patternMonday's surge signaled a potential end of the recent correction for crypto markets, which saw BTC drop below $61,000 last week from record prices above $73,000, coupled with tepid inflows to new U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs and increased selling of Grayscale's GBTC fund.Bitcoin could target new all-time highs after breaking out to the upside from its consolidation pattern, analytics firm 10x Research said in a Monday report. Based on a symmetrical triangle formation, a chart pattern in technical analysis, the breakout could foreshadow a $15,000 to $20,000 price increase for bitcoin's next move from around the $63,000 level, the report said. That would drive BTC as high as $83,000.Bitcoin could rise to $83,000 after breakout (10x research)Another critical level that BTC cleared today was the 2021 peak at $68,000, given that when previous market cycle tops were \"retested and broken once more, BTC has tended to put in significant rallies,\" said Markus Thielen, founder of 10x.The uptrend is supported by several central banks tilting toward dovish stances, which should benefit bitcoin, the report said.\"The Fed signaled that they are willing to accept higher inflation for longer and are eager to slow down quantitative tightening,\" Thielen said. \"The Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank also surprised on the dovish side.\"The report highlighted that bitcoin tends to perform well during U.S. election years – and 2024 is one – historically advancing 100%-200%, which also supports the case for higher prices later this year.\"Our upside targets of $83,000 and $102,000 could slowly be at play,\" Thielen said.Updated (15:45 UTC, 3/25/24): Notes price moving past $70K.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest digital asset, traded at $67,000, up 3% on a 24-hour basis, and ether traded 2.3% higher above $3,400. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, was up around 3.2% at press time. Bradley Park, an analyst at CryptoQuant, attributes the gains to the market digesting BlackRock's fund targeting tokenized products (BUIDL) on Ethereum. Other tokens gaining on Monday were Internet Computer (ICP), which added 20%, Ondo Finance’s ONDO, rising 15%, and Near protocol (NEAR), also about 15% higher over 24 hours.Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, was charged with tax evasion by Nigerian authorities as a weekslong standoff between the two parties intensified, local media outlets reported Monday, citing a statement from the country's tax watchdog. The charges, which also name two Binance executives detained by the government, were announced by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, one outlet reported. The exchange is being charged with four counts of tax evasion, including \"non-payment of Value-Added Tax (VAT), Company Income Tax, failure to tax returns, and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform.\"The cryptocurrency market remains fixated on spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows rather than fundamentals, as the recently approved products saw their first week of net outflows in two months, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Friday. Coinbase noted that net outflows amounted to $836 million between March 18 and March 21. Bitcoin slipped below $63,000 last week as the outflows sped up. It was recently trading at around $66,800. There is little insight into what drove the surge in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which reached $1.83 billion in total over four days, the report said.Chart of the DayThe chart shows the number of new Solana-based tokens created per day.The daily count surged to nearly 10,000 early this month.The increased network activity, fueled by memecoins and politically-themed tokens, has users rushing to purchase the token to access the Solana ecosystem, 21Shares said.That's creating a reflexive demand for Solana's SOL token analogous to the impact on ETH during 2017's ICO craze, 21Shares added.Source: SolscanTrending PostsEU Markets Watchdog Steps Closer to Finalizing Rules Under MiCABlackRock Seeing Only 'A Little Bit' Demand for Ethereum from Clients, Says Head of Digital AssetsEl Salvador Doubles Down on BitcoinEdited by Sheldon Reback."

In other words, the spot volume has been concentrated in ETFs, which also explains the low on-chain volume.Nevertheless, other metrics also indicate that investors who survived the 2022 bear market are holding onto their coin stash in anticipation of a continued price rally.For instance, the percentage of bitcoin supply that was last active between hree and five years ago continues to increase. Several analysts expect bitcoin's price to rally into six figures in the coming months, eventually peaking well above $150,000.\"Once we see the price really start to move, that's when on-chain volume will surge.

A modest rebound since has taken the price back to the current $64,000, down 3.7% over the past 24 hours.The sell-off rippled through the market, with the broad CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by 4.4% over the same time frame, led by layer-1 network Solana's token (SOL) declining more than 10% at one point.It's been more than a week when BTC turned sharply lower from its fresh all-time high price over $73,000 and crypto assets entered a corrective period. While Wednesday's steep, 10% rally on the back of a dovish Federal Reserve promised a quick recovery, the price action since suggests otherwise.\"[It] will take some time before we take out that $73,000 again,\" said Mike Novogratz, CEO of digital asset investment company Galaxy Digital, during a panel discussion at Bitcoin Investor Day in New York Friday morning.The weak price action comes as U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs have suffered what's now four consecutive days of net negative flows. To be sure, nearly all the funds continue to see inflows, but each day this week, they've not been nearly enough to offset massive outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). On Thursday, GBTC saw $359 million in outflows, leading to $94 million in outflows for the entire fund group. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) garnered the lowest daily inflow in its history, data compiled by BitMEX Research shows.So far through the week, the spot ETFs have recorded over $830 million outflows, and are on track to endure their second negative week since late January when BTC corrected to $39,000.Analysts at Coinbase Institutional noted that the increased GBTC selling is potentially in part due to Genesis selling shares as part of its bankruptcy process. Once the sales are completed, the report said, inflows to ETFs could pick up again amid favorable macro conditions and favorable central bank policy.\"We think the macro environment remains amenable for more spot bitcoin ETF inflows following the Federal Reserve meeting that concluded on March 20,\" the Coinbase authors wrote. \"We expect the current US disinflationary trend to remain intact, financial conditions in the US to continue easing, and markets to be supported by the tapering of the Fed’s quantitative tightening program.\"Helene Braun contributed reportingEdited by Stephen Alpher."

        "content": "In a series of strategic moves that underline its commitment to cryptocurrency, El Salvador continues to deepen its engagement with the digital currency market, particularly bitcoin (BTC). President Nayib Bukele recently announced El Salvador's plan to buy one bitcoin every day, aiming to continue this practice until it becomes unaffordable with fiat currencies. This initiative has pushed the nation's bitcoin holdings to a substantial total of 5,690 BTC, valued at approximately $400 million.This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Tatiana Koffman leads investment firm Moonwalker Capital, is the author of the popular financial newsletter MythOfMoney.com.In tandem with its cryptocurrency endeavors, El Salvador has made a bold statement in the global investment landscape by eliminating income tax for international investments and money transfers. This tax cut, from 30%-0%, is designed to attract foreign investors and boost economic growth.The country's commitment to bitcoin was further highlighted this week as it transferred more than 5,000 BTC into a cold wallet. President Bukele disclosed that a significant portion of these assets, amounting to $400 million worth of bitcoin, has been moved to an offline device stored in a physical vault within the nation's territory. This move to secure the digital assets in a \"Bitcoin piggy bank\" marks a significant step in El Salvador's financial strategy, offering a higher level of security and signaling strong faith in the cryptocurrency's future.The decision to make the transfer to a cold wallet came after El Salvador's bitcoin treasury swelled unexpectedly, nearly doubling its previously known stash. The country had been acquiring bitcoin through various means, including daily purchases, sales of passports, currency conversions for businesses, mining and government services. This approach has dramatically increased El Salvador's bitcoin holdings, which were believed to be less than 3,000 BTC before this revelation.See also: El Salvador Holds More Bitcoin Than ExpectedEl Salvador's pioneering stance on bitcoin began in September 2021 when it became the first country to adopt the digital currency as legal tender. Since then, bitcoin's value has seen significant fluctuations, recently hitting a record high of $73,800. The country's ongoing daily bitcoin purchases and the creation of a tax-free crypto haven powered by geothermal energy from a volcano showcase its innovative approach to harnessing cryptocurrency for economic development.President Bukele's vision extends beyond merely accumulating bitcoin; he envisions transforming El Salvador into a wealthy nation through strategic investments and initiatives related to the digital currency. Despite criticisms and warnings from international bodies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), El Salvador's commitment to its bitcoin strategy remains steadfast, with the nation showing no signs of divesting from the cryptocurrency.El Salvador's bold foray into the world of bitcoin and its efforts to create a conducive environment for cryptocurrency investments reflect a significant shift in how nations perceive and engage with digital currencies. As the country continues its bitcoin acquisition program and enhances its cryptocurrency infrastructure, it sets a precedent for others to follow, potentially reshaping the global financial landscape in the process."

FTM’s price surged to $1.16, the highest since April 2022, according to data tracked by CoinGecko. The token’s market capitalization jumped to $3.29 billion, becoming the 44th largest digital asset in the world. Fantom’s impending Sonic upgrade, expected to boost transaction processing speeds, may have galvanized investor interest in the cryptocurrency. The Sonic mainnet will replace the existing Opera mainnet in the next few months. Sonic’s testnet went live in October. The closed testnet with simulated traffic has demonstrated a maximum theoretical throughput of 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) and a time to finality of 1.1 seconds. Opera is processing just 3.2 TPS.Bitcoin (BTC) tested $66,000 during Asian trading hours on Friday, and market observers expect the leading cryptocurrency to face more volatility. The cryptocurrency has since retraced to around $64,800. “Bitcoin remains volatile with the drawdown of 10% we saw this week, with the recent catalyst being driven by spot bitcoin ETF outflows from GBTC of about 300mm on March 20,” Semir Gabeljic, director of capital formation at Pythagoras Investments, said in an email interview. “The drawdown still remains in line with the expected range of 10-20% as we’ve seen historically that happens right before the BTC halving event. More volatility is expected to come going into the BTC halving,” he continued.

The sell-off may not be over as positioning still looks overbought, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Thursday.“There remains considerable optimism in the market over the prospect for prices rising significantly by year-end, with a significant component of that optimism arising from a view that bitcoin demand via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would continue at the same pace even as the supply of bitcoin diminishes after the halving event,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.The quadrennial reward halving is when miners’ rewards are cut in half. The next halving is expected in mid-April.However, the bank notes that the pace of net inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs has slowed considerably, with a significant outflow recorded in the past week.“This challenges the notion that the spot bitcoin ETF flow picture is going to be characterized as a sustained one-way net inflow,” the authors wrote.“In fact, as we approach the halving event this profit-taking is more likely to continue, particularly against a positioning backdrop that still looks overbought despite the past week’s correction,” the report said.Read more: Bitcoin Halving May Have a Positive Impact on Prices, But Other Factors Still at Play: CoinbaseEdited by Sheldon Reback."

QCP expects a fourth consecutive day of BTC spot exchange-traded fund net outflows.Regarding ether (ETH), QCP says that the market is starting to price out the chances of a spot ether ETF being approved anytime soon.“The Grayscale ETH discount has widened from -8% to -20% over the past two weeks,” QCP noted.Prediction markets also reflect this. On Polymarket, a contract asking if an Ethereum ETF will be approved by May 31 is currently trading with a 21% probability that this will be the case.The Ethereum Foundation is currently being investigated by a state authority, which Fortune says is the Securities and Exchange Commission. The question remains whether the SEC considers ether a security, and the Commission hasn’t been responsive to FOIA requests for key documents that would shed insight into its views on the issue.Blockchain bettors on Polymarket also believe that the second quarter is when ether will hit its all-time high, but a sizable portion of traders also think there will be no all-time highs in 2024.Ether is currently trading above $3500, up 1.2%, according to CoinDesk Indices data.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

The next event is likely to occur on April 15.“Bitcoin doesn’t operate in a vacuum,” and its price is affected by other influences, such as macro factors, Coinbase said. The report noted that much of bitcoin’s outperformance after the previous halving in May 2020 came in an “environment with extraordinarily loose monetary policy and historically strong fiscal stimulus in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.”Similarly, the recent rally in the world’s largest cryptocurrency was fuelled more by fever about the prospects of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) than by excitement over the halving, the note said.Another data point worth considering when looking at the upcoming halving is the total supply of bitcoin held by long-term holders, Coinbase said, adding that “long-term holders should be less likely than short-term holders to view halving as an opportunity to sell into strength.” The amount of bitcoin currently held by long-term holders is quite high by historical standards.On the positive side, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates in May and to start tapering its quantitative tightening program, which is positive for risk assets, the report added.Read more: Bernstein Is ‘Now More Convinced’ That Bitcoin Will Hit $150K After Massive RallyEdited by Parikshit Mishra."

The spread recently widened beyond $1,000.Speculative frenzy, or periods of intense speculation characterized by irrational exuberance and greed, is an infamous sign of an impending market top.However, tracking signs of speculative frenzy in the bitcoin (BTC) market requires access to and understanding of sophisticated indicators like perpetual funding rates and social trends. But there is another surprisingly more straightforward way: tracking the spread or difference between prices for next-month and front-month futures contracts trading on major exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Deribit.The “front-month contract” has an expiration date closest to the current date. The contract expiring in two months is called the next-month contract.The futures term structure is usually upward sloping, as contracts with a more extended expiry time trade at a premium to short-duration ones. That said, when the spread becomes too large, it’s a good indicator of speculative sentiment, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin.“Usually, when the spread between the next months and the front months is large, investors’ speculation sentiment is high, and they are willing to pay higher costs to hold long positions,” Ardern told CoinDesk. “You can find clues into Deribit’s term structure.”The same applies to CME’s standard futures contracts, sized at 5 BTC and considered a proxy for institutional activity.The spread between the CME-listed next- and front-month contracts widened beyond $1,000 in late February 2021 and mid-October 2021, signaling speculative frenzy and presaging bull market peaks by a few weeks. In other words, the wider spread was a sign the bull market was in its final stages.BTC CME futures spread and spot price on Coinbase.

There's also plenty of gawking at the meme coin frenzy on Solana. (Who doesn't like sloths?)In this week's issue of The Protocol:Exclusive interview with Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko (on this week's The Protocol podcast) regarding what he thinks of meme coin traders, and why he welcomes the latest episode of congestion as a network stress test.Craig Wright, Polygon, Starbucks, GCR, Dogwifhat, Peter Schiff, Ether.Fi.Top picks from this week's Protocol Village column: Mysten Labs, Sui, Starknet, OP Labs, Stellar, Conio.More than $60M of blockchain project fundraisings.Dencun postscript: Which Ethereum layer-2 network is seeing the cheapest fees?This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.Network newsHALVE TIME: The expected date of the next Bitcoin halving keeps creeping forward – thanks to miners upgrading to faster, more powerful machines and powering up older models, incentivized by this year's BTC price runup to a new all-time high around $74,000. The halving's ETA is now somewhere around mid-April, a couple weeks earlier than was expected a few months ago. A similar thing happened four years ago, when prices were also surging, essentially causing the blockchain to speed up. What's different this time around – and perhaps different from pretty much every prior halving in the network's 15-year history – is how many projects are now targeting the event for hype-inducing launches and other frenzy-inciting pursuits. Chief among those is the planned launch of Runes, the fungible-token protocol being developed by Casey Rodarmor, whose launch of the Ordinals protocol last year, with its NFT-like inscriptions, caused a sensation on Bitcoin, driving up transactional activity along with fees and congestion. There could also be a scramble to mine block No. 840,000, where the halving is supposed to automatically occur. In the past, mining the all-important halving block brought little more than bragging rights and the chance to embed a message into the blockchain, for posterity. (In 2020, winner F2Pool wrote something about the U.S. Federal Reserve's Covid-related money-printing.) But now, with the introduction of the Ordinals protocol, it's possible to actually trade specific serial numbers to the tiniest increments of Bitcoin, known as satoshis or \"sats.\" And there's a premium for the especially precious \"rare sats\" corresponding with milestones like the halving. Already, as reported by CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn, people are predicting that block 840,000 could be \"the most valuable block to be mined to date.\" There's also the risk that the competition could get so intense that things go horribly awry, resulting in a nasty \"reorg.\" Pretty crypto, right?ALSO:Decentralized exchange Aevo's founder acknowledged that a recent spike in daily trading volume to over $4.5 billion was partly caused by some users \"pumping volumes to $1 billion+ to get more out of our airdrop,\" adding that it's \"not happening anymore.\"Polygon Labs paid $4 million to Starbucks in 2022 as part of the latte chain's soon-to-be-sunsetted NFT-based loyalty program, Odyssey, people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk's Danny Nelson.GCR, the crypto trader who became known in 2022 for coordinating successful bets against token prices that later collapsed, reportedly paid $4 million worth of ether (ETH) for the original image that inspired Solana's runaway hit meme coin dogwifhat (WIF).(Dogwifhat)Ethereum developers are posting the entire script of the Bee Movie, an animated comedy by comedian Jerry Seinfeld about a bee who sues humans, on the second-largest blockchain – in an apparent demonstration of how cheap fees have become following the network's landmark Dencun upgrade last week.Computer scientist Craig Wright, who has long claimed he is the inventor of Bitcoin, is not in fact Satoshi Nakamoto, and didn't author Bitcoin whitepaper, a U.K. judge ruled in the closely-watched Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) trial.

The latency per transaction decreased as more machines were added, proving the viability of linear horizontal scaling for low latency blockchain transactions for the first time ever on any blockchain.\"The developers behind Starknet, the Ethereum layer-2 network whose $2.3 billion STRK token airdrop last month captivated crypto markets, plan to add a design feature known as \"parallelization\" – one of the factors that reportedly makes rival blockchain Solana popular as a venue for fast, cheap transactions. The feature will go live as part of an upgrade set for the second quarter, allowing Starknet to \"process a greater number of transactions simultaneously, resulting in improved throughput and faster L2 finality,\" according to a press release distributed by a representative of the developer StarkWare. It is part of the 2024 road map released Wednesday. OP Labs, the main development firm behind the Optimism blockchain, planned Tuesday to begin testing fault proofs on Ethereum's Sepolia test network. The new deployment comes a few months after Optimism launched an initial version of fault proofs on Goerli, another Ethereum test network, in October. Karl Floersch, co-founder of Optimism and CEO of OP Labs, told CoinDesk he expects the proofs to reach Ethereum's main network later this year, with the Sepolia deployment bringing the team closer than ever to this goal.The Stellar Development Foundation, the nonprofit supporting development and growth of the Stellar network, announced that the phased rollout of Soroban, Stellar’s smart contracts platform, is now complete, enabling anyone to build, deploy and interact with Stellar-based dApps, according to the team. CoinDesk 20 asset: XLMConio, a financial technology company partly owned by Poste Italiane and Banca Generali, announced the acquisition of a new patent in the U.S., No. 11,915,314, showcasing a cutting-edge multi-signature model for the creation, custody, recovery and management of a digital asset. According to the team: \"The solution, designed to be blockchain agnostic compared to the blockchain used and therefore adaptable to different digital assets, involves the generation of three private keys, only two of which are needed to authorize transactions, thus enabling the recovery of the digital asset if one of the three private keys is unavailable.\"Schematic from Conio's new patent for a \"Method and apparatus for a blockchain-agnostic safe multi-signature digital-asset management.\" (Conio/U.S. Patent Office)See the entire Protocol Village list from this past week here. Solana Strained by Meme Coin Mania, But Co-Founder Yakovenko Welcomes the TestThe Solana blockchain is in the midst of what some might call a renaissance, its SOL token rebounding almost entirely from all-time-lows in 2020. But recently, it's the source of activity on the chain that might give some analysts pause: Meme coins built around images of dogs and sloths, general ridiculousness and even the very concept of memes themselves.The chain, which aims to offer cheaper and quicker transactions than rival networks like Ethereum, has become the go-to platform for meme coins like dogwifhat (WIF), bonk (BONK), and book of meme (BOME) – tokens whose value lies principally (and unabashedly) in their ability to generate internet buzz. A new arrival is SLERF, a sloth-themed token.Hordes of \"degens\" – the accepted jargon for crypto traders who are, well, really into it – have flocked to Solana, chasing the trend. Mature observers might call it a display of some of the crypto industry's worst excesses, morphing the Solana ecosystem into a carnival of scams, schemes and screw-ups.\"To me, it's just a bizarre thing, I think, of people being terminally online and kind of having nothing better to do,\" Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko told CoinDesk this week in an interview for The Protocol podcast.The meme coin boom has triggered a flurry of activity for the wider Solana ecosystem, with decentralized exchanges on the network surpassing those on Ethereum in terms of overall transaction volume this week. But users are beginning to notice a problem: Many transactions on Solana are failing to go through – highlighting the consequence of meme coin-induced volatility and congestion.The meme craze has ultimately been a mixed bag for Solana, leading to an influx in usage and liquidity, but dredging up problems with its architecture that have left a sour taste in the mouths of some traders.Click here for the full interview by Sam KesslerMoney CenterFundraisingsPolyhedra Network, the Web 3 infrastructure provider behind the zero-knowledge protocol zkBridge, has closed a $20 million fundraising round valuing the company at $1 billion, the firm said in a press release Thursday.

One thing that's already clear is just how massive the fee reductions will be for layer-2 networks that settle transactions on the main Ethereum chain.Median fees on Arbitrum, the biggest Ethereum layer 2, was around 5.8 cents as of Tuesday, down from about 40 cents just before the upgrade went through. Optimism, a rival layer 2, was seeing fees around 0.7 cents, down from about 50 cents. On the publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase's own layer 2, Base, the fees dropped from about 30 cents to about 0.6 cents – hitting the company's target for \"sub-cent\" transaction costs.Chart showing drop in cost of median layer-2 network fees before and after last week's Dencun upgrade.

The dot plot is the Fed committee members' outlook on interest rates over the next year and offers investors a glimpse into policymakers' expectations.The Fed \"dot plot\" in March (Federal Reserve)Crypto hedge fund QCP Capital said earlier Wednesday that if the dot plot were to show less cuts for this year instead of three, it would be bearish for bitcoin.Before the FOMC announcement, most market participants had priced the first rate cut for June. Now, the market puts 70% odds for at least one rate cut by June, up from over 60% earlier, according to CME FedWatch Tool data.The decision followed hotter-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports, sparking concerns that inflation might accelerate and forcing the U.S. central bank to keep financial conditions tight and delay rate cuts, potentially weighing on asset prices.\"Tighter monetary policies dampen risk appetite in financial markets while lower rates increase the allure of asset classes such as crypto,\" digital asset management firm 21Shares noted Wednesday.Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $64,000 before the meeting from its overnight low of $60,700, then spiked to $64,700 in the immediate aftermath of the decision.

It's a natural, pre-programmed part of the blockchain's underlying code.Astute observers may have noticed, however, that the expected time and date keeps creeping closer.The halving is currently looking likely to fall around April 19 or 20th, according to Nicehash's countdown. Just a few months ago, it was supposed to come on April 28.A similar phenomenon was observed in the run-up to the last halving four years ago, and history appears to be repeating itself.The halving is considered a momentous event by many, seen as a catalyst for bull runs in the bitcoin (BTC) price and certainly a talking point in this year's runup to an all-time high just over $69,000. As the theory goes, if fewer new bitcoins are being created and demand keeps surging, they're harder to come by, so the value of those already in existence increases. April's halving will see the block reward reduce to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.But there's another dynamic playing out in the bitcoin market: As the price of the cryptocurrency rises, the rewards of mining it get richer, and more operators are encouraged to turn on their machines or ramp up their computational power, known as \"hashrate.\"Please See: Consensus Magazine's Bitcoin Halving CollectionA recent surge in hashrate has sped up the creation of new blocks as mining companies seek to cash in, and they've pushed even harder by bringing newer, more powerful equipment online.Not so long ago, the Bitcoin mining-machine maker Antminer's S19s were all the rage. Now the S21s are the top of the line.\"The modern S19 miners series averages around 120 terahashes per second (TH/s), but when you plug in an S21, you're almost doubling that hash rate per slot,\" Taylor Monnig, senior vice president of technology for bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK), said in an interview.Halvings officially take place every 210,000 blocks, which works out at around once every four years as a new block is added to the network every 10 minutes on average.There are occasional \"difficulty adjustments\" to maintain the cadence, but over periods of time – and especially in bull markets – the blockchain can speed up.Some firms will reinstall older kit that may soon be obsolete, in order to squeeze every drop of hash power out of their mining fleets as the halving approaches.\"Global hash rate was going to grow because lots of people ordered lots of machines. That's the number one factor,\" Adam Swick, chief growth officer of mining firm Marathon Digital (MARA), said in an interview. \"Not as significant, but still evident, is that also people are re-plugging in some old machines due to the prices being high.\"Read More: U.S. President Again Proposes Crypto Mining Tax, 'Wash Sale Rule' for Digital Assets in New BudgetEdited by Bradley Keoun."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesBitcoin’s (BTC) price correction gathered pace Tuesday as the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) fell out of favor. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell over 8% to under $62,000, data from charting platform TradingView shows. That’s the biggest single-day percentage (UTC) decline since Nov. 9, 2022. That day, prices tanked over 14% as Sam Bankman Fried’s FTX, formerly the third largest crypto exchange, went bankrupt. Bitcoin’s latest price slide has been catalyzed by several factors, including outflows from the spot ETFs, according to trader and economist Alex Kruger. Provisional data published by investment firm Farside show that on Tuesday, there was a net outflow of $326 million from the spot ETFs, the largest on record. On Monday, Grayscale’s ETF witnessed a record outflow of $643 million. “Reasons for the crash, in order of importance: #1 Too much leverage (funding matters). #2 ETH driving market south (market decided ETF was not passing). #3 Negative BTC ETF inflows (careful, data is T+1). #4 Solana shitcoin mania (it went too far),” Kruger said on X.Web3 gaming developer platform Immutable and venture capital company King River Capital have teamed up to form a $100 million “Inevitable Games Fund” (IGF) with help from Polygon Labs. IGF will target high-growth opportunities for professional and sophisticated investors in Web3 gaming, according to an emailed announcement on Tuesday. Immutable and Polygon Labs will identify investment opportunities, while King River will manage the investment process and deploy the capital across game studios and Web3 infrastructure firms. The fund is hoping to capture the opportunity in the Web3 gaming industry. “Since 2018, the sector has attracted approximately $19 billion in investments. In 2023, blockchain gaming-related rounds reached $1.7 billion. A significant part of that has flowed to the 270+ blockchain games in development on Immutable,” the press release said, citing industry research.Investment management giant BlackRock (BLK) has created a fund called the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fund, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, will be launched in partnership with asset tokenization firm Securitize. The filing does not reveal what assets the fund will hold. Still, Securitize’s presence potentially suggests the product has something to do with the tokenization of real-world assets, or RWA – industry jargon for representing ownership of a wide range of assets through a token on a blockchain. After BlackRock’s filing came out, Ondo Finance’s native token ONDO jumped as much as 20%. Ondo runs a RWA platform.Chart of the DayThe chart shows three- and six-month bitcoin call-put skews.Positive values indicate a bias for calls expiring in three and six months.Options traders continue to see higher prices for bitcoin over 90 and 180 days despite the recent market weakness.Call options allow the purchaser to buy the underlying securities at a particular price in the future.Source: Amberdata, DeribitTrending PostsLithuania-Licensed Crypto Bank Meld to Offer Tokenized RWAs to Retail Investors3AC Co-Founder Kyle Davies Says He Won’t Apologize for Crypto Hedge Fund Going 'Bankrupt'Crypto Fan Won Ohio Senate Primary That Could Alter the Industry's U.S. DestinyEdited by Parikshit Mishra."

Futures positions showed no bias as of writing time, with longs and shorts equally making up 50% of all futures positions.Major tokens stabilized dropping as much as 15%, CoinGecko data show. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, an index of various major tokens minus stablecoins, was little changed over the past 24 hours with losses of just 0.34%.Ether (ETH) fell briefly under the $3,100 level on Tuesday night as analysts lowered the odds of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing widely expected for May. Several other layer-1, or base, blockchains also dropped, with tokens of Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX) and Cardano (ADA) losing 8% over 24 hours. Meme coins and exchange tokens outperformed with a 5% drop.Overall market capitalization has declined by almost 15% in the past week. The total cap was down to $2.28 trillion on Wednesday morning, rising to $2.35 trillion by the start of active trading in Europe.Meanwhile, some traders say that bitcoin price action suggests the asset is in a downtrend and investors must look to favorable macroeconomic developments before considering bets. The U.S. Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) is due to set interest rates and discuss the economy later today.\"Bitcoin remains in a downtrend, with a series of lower lows and lower highs,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “We will pay attention to bitcoin’s dynamics at the following support levels: $60.3K (correction to 61.8% of the last rally), $56K area (50-day average and 50% level) and $51.5K (consolidation area in February).”“Crypto traders should now keep a close eye on the appetite for risk in the financial markets. Today, it will be heavily influenced by the FOMC and other major central bank meetings later in the week,” Kuptsikevich said.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Such a one-sided buildup of leverage on the bullish side often presages price corrections.Investors will now closely watch Wednesday’s Federal Reserve rate decision, which Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference will follow.“This upcoming week, we will have the Fed rate decision followed by Powell’s press conference. This will give us more insight into whether the Fed is still seeing rate cuts on the horizon this year.

        "content": "It’s not often in crypto that you can say “this time is different” in good faith. But this time it really is different for Bitcoin’s halving, slated for next month. As Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo noted recently, this is the first time bitcoin (BTC) has rallied before the programmatic slashing of block rewards — all three prior halvings (2020, 2016, 2012) preceded a major runup in crypto prices.This column is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. It also published in The Node newsletter, a daily rundown of the most pivotal stories and why they matter. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteNo one can say for certain how the Bitcoin halving will affect the cryptocurrency’s price; we’re in uncharted territory in terms of technical analysis. Whether the halving accelerates bitcoin’s run-up or terminates it is historic, and a challenge to popular belief that crypto is locked into four-year market cycles of booms and busts anchored to these events.However, there are a few other ways this Bitcoin halving, the fourth in the network’s lifetime, is already unprecedented.Transaction feesNot only is this the first halving when bitcoin’s price has climbed before the event, but it’s also the first time when transaction fees represent a significant portion of bitcoin miners’ revenues. Transaction fees are tied to network use, and ever since the launch of the Ordinals protocol — which enables users to “inscribe” arbitrary data on-chain to make NFT-like assets — network usage is way up.See also: What the Bitcoin Halving Means for Miners and Prices | OpinionWhile this doesn’t say anything about BTC’s price, it could impact how many and what kinds of mining equipment remain active following the halving. Typically the halving is like a wildfire that clears out outdated ASICs that are no longer profitable to run after the “block subsidy” is cut in half.Most valuable block ever?The halving will occur at block height 840,000 (a count of how many blocks have been hashed to the blockchain), and already people are predicting that will be the most valuable block to be mined to date. This is related to the point above: Ordinals works by assigning serial numbers to individual satoshis (or sats, the smallest denomination of BTC), which turns a fungible asset like bitcoin into something with provenance, identity and scarcity.Tristan, the founder of Ordiscan.com, which tracks Ordinals projects, predicts that collectors of these “rare sats” could value the data in block 840,000 at $50 million dollars. Under the “Rodarmor Rarity” system, which assigns value to Bitcoin protocol events like difficulty adjustments and halvings, the first satoshi in the block alone could be worth upwards of $1 million, he wrote in a blog post.RunesBecause the halving is such a momentous moment for the community, many companies plan launches or announcements that coincide with it. This year is no different in that regard, except what’s being announced is another new token primitive for Bitcoin: Casey Rodarmor’s latest protocol design called Runes.See also: Bitcoin Halving Is a 'Show Me the Money' Moment for MinersIn short, Runes is an alternative way to launch Bitcoin-based tokens (not dissimilar to altcoins that are launched on Ethereum). There is a lot of attention on the protocol given the success of Ordinals, and already a number of projects have announced intentions to launch their Runes tokens on the first sat of the halving block.'Mother of all reorgs'Furthermore, because the halving block is potentially so valuable, Tristan predicts that there will be a lot of competition for miners to acquire it by any means necessary. “Block 840,000 is worth at least 2 orders of magnitude more than any other block before it,” he writes. “This has never happened before, and dangling that huge money pot in front of miners will make it extremely hard for them to play by the usual rules.”What this all adds up to is that miners could potentially try to front-run another to acquire the block, in a process known as miner extractable value (MEV). Tristan isn’t the only one to predict a possible “reorg” of the chain. The idea of transaction sniping also came up on Will Foxley’s “Mining Pod” recently, with the “rare sat” in question being valued at a more conservative 10 BTC."

An AI model is a tool or algorithm based on a specific data set to arrive at a decision.“We’ve figured out a way to put AI on-chain,” lead developer punk3700 said. “It’s the same but with a much bigger impact than putting jpegs on-chain like ordinals,” he said.“They are neural networks (technical terms for AI) where users can create their own AI models, make money from them (when people use their AI models) per call, or sell the entire models,” he added.The developer said that Filecoin, Near, Avail, Polygon, and Syscoin will provide the storage layers for the AI models.AI tokens remain a hot narrative for crypto traders because the technology is expected to drive key innovations in the global economy in the coming years.However, the relationship between AI and crypto is unclear: Some market experts say artificial intelligence cannot run on a blockchain, even though scores of projects claim otherwise.At the time of writing, Bitcoin Virtual Machine’s BVM token was trading at $2, down 20% in the past 24 hours, in line with a marketwide drop.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteThere’s a lot happening all at once in Bitcoin-land these days. Following the launch of spot market exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., bitcoin’s price has been rocketing up — regularly setting new all-time highs. Some of the world’s most influential figures — from former President Donald Trump to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink — have lately been praising crypto. Banks are building ways to give their clients exposure to the coin.See also: Paul Dylan-Ennis — The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | OpinionPerhaps the most significant shift, however, has been the changing culture around the first and largest cryptocurrency. For years, Bitcoin culture has been dominated by Bitcoin maxis, which when worn as a badge-of-honor by insiders means they believe Bitcoin is the only blockchain worth building but is also a pejorative to say someone has a toxic attachment to bitcoin.However, is it too much to say that these fans of hard money are going a little … soft? If “the class of Bitcoin 2021” was dominated by laser-eye maxis who only ate beef and attacked people on Twitter, today it seems Bitcoin is far less aggro.I’m not the only one who senses the vibe shift. In a recent interview with Stacks creator Muneeb Ali, he mentioned that he has been getting a lot less hate on X. Although a Bitcoin maximalist in the sense that Ali thinks anything other cryptocurrencies could do could be imported to Bitcoin, and that BTC is superior money, Ali has spent the last decade as a blockchain developer essentially getting harassed by his peers for launching an altcoin.“Honestly, it's getting much better. It was the Dark Ages of Bitcoin before,” Ali said in a recent phone interview. “It's getting a lot better because there are new builders coming and new tools being built. There’s excitement in the builders community.”Ali is referring to the spurt of activity on Bitcoin ever since Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinals protocol, which opened the door to “inscribing” NFT-like data on Bitcoin and inspired a host of other innovative ideas to try out.Mind you, not everyone is happy about this. Ever since Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinals protocol there has also been a raging debate within the Bitcoin community over exactly what Bitcoin is for. The debate is essentially between two ideological camps, money crypto versus tech crypto (to bastardize a term coined by CoinDesk contributor and ConsenSys lawyer Bill Hughes).To find where you stand on the spectrum, ask yourself whether Bitcoin is just and only “savings technology,” a hard money solution to ever-inflating fiat currency? Or, is it also a platform to build fun or useful applications? For years, Bitcoin culture had been dominated by the former, in part because there wasn’t much you could do with Bitcoin.See also: You Can Be a Bitcoin Maximalist and Like Ethereum, Too | Opinion“Money Bitcoin” people are those today who complain about things like Bitcoin-based NFTs and BRC-20 tokens “clogging up the network.” Everyday, it’s getting harder and harder to say whether they are the loudest or most influential voices in the room. That’s because fighting against technological innovation is an uphill battle (and also a bit hypocritical, considering the Bitcoin network was designed not to discriminate against anyone, no matter how they use it).To be fair, there’s nothing necessarily wrong with taking the position that bitcoin’s first and primary objective should be creating a new monetary paradigm. But there is something uncouth about telling people to “have fun staying poor” or to “stay toxic.”It’s common to hear that bitcoiners developed a hard shell (to keep it politic) in response to the criticism they received from non-holders over the years. Being proven right again and again (at least in terms of price) likely also helped foster a greater sense of smug self-satisfaction. There’s also the fact that, until recently, adopting bitcoin was genuinely a bit counter-cultural – a way to “drop out.”“Bitcoin’s original culture was a synthesis of determined cypherpunk and thoughtful libertarianism. It drew on previous movements, certainly, but this combination was completely ex nihilo, a once in a generation cultural event,” crypto researcher Paul Dylan-Ennis wrote in 2022.May it continue to evolve.See also: 'Greater Fools Are Watching': Bitcoin Is Here to Stay, Elites Say"

        "content": "Next month, the Bitcoin network will undergo its fourth halving since its launch in 2009. In honor of that occasion, CoinDesk is publishing a month-long editorial package covering everything from Bitcoin’s changing cultural scene to the technical advancements being planned today.This column is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. It was previously published in The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteThere’s a lot happening all at once in Bitcoin-land these days. Following the launch of spot market exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., bitcoin’s price has been rocketing up — regularly setting new all-time highs. Some of the world’s most influential figures — from former President Donald Trump to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink — have lately been praising crypto. Banks are building ways to give their clients exposure to the coin.See also: Paul Dylan-Ennis — The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | OpinionPerhaps the most significant shift, however, has been the changing culture around the first and largest cryptocurrency. For years, Bitcoin culture has been dominated by Bitcoin maxis, which when worn as a badge-of-honor by insiders means they believe Bitcoin is the only blockchain worth building but is also a pejorative to say someone has a toxic attachment to bitcoin.However, is it too much to say that these fans of hard money are going a little … soft? If “the class of Bitcoin 2021” was dominated by laser-eye maxis who only ate beef and attacked people on Twitter, today it seems Bitcoin is far less aggro.I’m not the only one who senses the vibe shift. In a recent interview with Stacks creator Muneeb Ali, he mentioned that he has been getting a lot less hate on X. Although a Bitcoin maximalist in the sense that Ali thinks anything other cryptocurrencies could do could be imported to Bitcoin, and that BTC is superior money, Ali has spent the last decade as a blockchain developer essentially getting harassed by his peers for launching an altcoin.“Honestly, it's getting much better. It was the Dark Ages of Bitcoin before,” Ali said in a recent phone interview. “It's getting a lot better because there are new builders coming and new tools being built. There’s excitement in the builders community.”Ali is referring to the spurt of activity on Bitcoin ever since Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinals protocol, which opened the door to “inscribing” NFT-like data on Bitcoin and inspired a host of other innovative ideas to try out.Mind you, not everyone is happy about this. Ever since Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinals protocol there has also been a raging debate within the Bitcoin community over exactly what Bitcoin is for. The debate is essentially between two ideological camps, money crypto versus tech crypto (to bastardize a term coined by CoinDesk contributor and ConsenSys lawyer Bill Hughes).To find where you stand on the spectrum, ask yourself whether Bitcoin is just and only “savings technology,” a hard money solution to ever-inflating fiat currency? Or, is it also a platform to build fun or useful applications? For years, Bitcoin culture had been dominated by the former, in part because there wasn’t much you could do with Bitcoin.See also: You Can Be a Bitcoin Maximalist and Like Ethereum, Too | Opinion“Money Bitcoin” people are those today who complain about things like Bitcoin-based NFTs and BRC-20 tokens “clogging up the network.” Everyday, it’s getting harder and harder to say whether they are the loudest or most influential voices in the room. That’s because fighting against technological innovation is an uphill battle (and also a bit hypocritical, considering the Bitcoin network was designed not to discriminate against anyone, no matter how they use it).To be fair, there’s nothing necessarily wrong with taking the position that bitcoin’s first and primary objective should be creating a new monetary paradigm. But there is something uncouth about telling people to “have fun staying poor” or to “stay toxic.”It’s common to hear that bitcoiners developed a hard shell (to keep it politic) in response to the criticism they received from non-holders over the years. Being proven right again and again (at least in terms of price) likely also helped foster a greater sense of smug self-satisfaction. There’s also the fact that, until recently, adopting bitcoin was genuinely a bit counter-cultural – a way to “drop out.”“Bitcoin’s original culture was a synthesis of determined cypherpunk and thoughtful libertarianism. It drew on previous movements, certainly, but this combination was completely ex nihilo, a once in a generation cultural event,” crypto researcher Paul Dylan-Ennis wrote in 2022.May it continue to evolve.See also: 'Greater Fools Are Watching': Bitcoin Is Here to Stay, Elites Say"

The bitcoin ETFs only booked $133 million and $198 million of net inflows on Thursday and Friday, respectively, while BTC turned sharply lower to below $65,000 over the weekend.Bitcoin's price found short-term support at those levels and stabilized at $67,000, but the \"real test\" will come Monday and Tuesday, with bitcoin's correction potentially continuing if ETF inflows disappoint, Markus Thielen, founder of 10X, wrote in a Monday report.\"While this is an unpopular narrative, it would be expected to see inflows slow down after prices experience significant intraday volatility,\" the report said. \"Based on our reversal indicators, a retracement to $59,035 appears more likely, offering better risk-reward entry levels,\" which would indicate another 10% drop from current BTC prices.Read more: Bitcoin Sells Off 3%; Is Macro Risk Returning to Market?Bitcoin broke its uptrend last week, falling to $65,000 over the weekend.

If BTC recovers above $70,000 – above its former all-time high in 2021 – the rally could open the door to much higher prices, he added.Earlier Monday, U.K. bank Standard Chartered (STAN) boosted its year-end bitcoin price target to $150,000 from $100,000, while predicting a $250,000 high for 2025.Edited by Nick Baker."

The CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the largest and most liquid digital assets, fell 6%. Data from CoinGlass shows that over $100 million in long positions were wiped out over 12 hours, and $167 million in longs liquidated in 24 hours. Other assets like gold and Wall Street's tech-heavy index Nasdaq also came under pressure this week.

A bitcoin treasury of that size places El Salvador's holdings far higher than previously thought. Even on Thursday, public trackers placed the nation's trove at less than 3,000 BTC ($205 million).

It allows users to create their own layer 2 networks and drives the value of its native BVM tokens.Developers told CoinDesk that the team plans \"juicy\" airdrops for BVM stakers, which could fuel demand for the tokens.Bitcoin Virtual Machine, a protocol founded late February, is gaining traction among traders betting on the general growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem, driving demand for its BVM tokens.Data shows that the project’s BVM tokens have added 35% in the past 24 hours, beating a general market decline. The CoinDesk 20 Index fell 5.3% in the same period. The tokens have surged to $3.5 from an intitial of 20 cents on March 8.The project lets users spin up their own layer-2 networks on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin and Ethereum are known as layer-1 protocols, and attempts to scale and expand them are layer 2s. While the Ethereum ecosystem has had multiple layer 2 projects aimed at providing faster, cheaper transactions for years, the Bitcoin version really kicked off only in 2023 following the introduction of Ordinals technology.The value propositions for the token are driven by staking rewards for BVM holders and a cut of fees generated by the service, developer @punk3700 told CoinDesk in a direct message interview on X.“We have 40%-50% circulating staked by our holders. Working on a few airdrop deals for BVM stakers,” @punk3700 said. “Some of them could be quite juicy.”On Friday, the team said Naka Chain, a Bitcoin layer-2 build on BVM, will airdrop 10.5 million tokens to BVM token stakers. The airdrop is proportional to a user’s staked holdings and will be locked for three months.Tokens based on the Bitcoin blockchain first started to emerge as an investment thesis in mid-2023, led by Ordinals technology and BRC-20 tokens.The BRC-20 standard (BRC stands for Bitcoin Request for Comment) was introduced in April and allowed users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network for the first time. The tokens, called inscriptions, function on the Ordinals Protocol. That protocol allows users to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small bitcoin-based transactions.@punk3700 previously told CoinDesk that bitcoin’s usage in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications has so far been limited to tokenized representations of bitcoin on other chains, such as Ethereum or Solana, but that there’s a gap for wealthy bitcoin holders to use their assets on native applications, fueling the investment thesis.The BRC-20 tokens have a cumulative $3.5 billion market capitalization as of Friday, CoinGecko data shows.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

However, prices are still up 60% year-to-date, CoinDesk data shows. Nvidia has pulled back 9% from its lifetime peak of $974 but still boasts a year-to-date gain of 77.5%.In five years, bitcoin’s market capitalization has jumped to $1.43 trillion from $70 billion. Similarly, Nvidia’s market value has increased to over $2 trillion from around $100 billion.The growing demand for Nvidia processors from ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) projects has been primarily responsible for the surge in the chip makers’ valuations.The 90-day correlation coefficient between the two has risen to 0.86, the highest since May 2023, having flipped positive in November, according to charting platform TradingView. The 52-week correlation has been consistently positive since July 2020 and has now risen to 0.88, the highest since January 2023.A coefficient of over 0.80 indicates that bitcoin and NVDA are highly correlated and tend to move in the same direction.52-week correlation between BTC and NVDA. (TradingView/CoinDesk) (TradingView/CoinDesk)The statistical relationship is noteworthy, as some market observers, including investment management firm GMO, worry that the AI frenzy is similar to the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.The launch of ChatGPT in December 2022 helped raise general awareness about artificial intelligence, and the subsequent love affair with AI stocks represents a “bubble within a bubble,” which could start to deflate,” GMO’s Chief Investment Strategist Jeremy Grantham explained in a paper published on Monday. Both bitcoin and Wall Street’s tech-heavy Nasdaq index bottomed out in December 2022.“Every technological revolution like this [AI] – going back from the internet to telephones, railroads, or canals – has been accompanied by early massive hype and a stock market bubble as investors focus on the ultimate possibilities of the technology, pricing most of the very long-term potential immediately into current market prices,” Grantham noted, calling AI a bubble.“And many such revolutions are, in the end, often as transformative as those early investors could see and sometimes even more so – but only after a substantial period of disappointment during which the initial bubble bursts,” Grantham added.Meanwhile, strategists at Citi said AI is the bubble but could last into 2025, according to Investing.com.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "Bitcoin bulls so far this year have had a respite from having to pay attention to things like the economy and Federal Reserve monetary policy thanks to the overwhelming demand for the crypto from the new spot ETFs. For the moment, at least, that appears to be changing.Thursday morning's Producer Price Index (PPI) for February was yet another data point that perky inflation is proving far stickier than most expected. The government report said PPI was higher by 0.6% last month, doubling the pace in January and also double economist forecasts. The so-called core PPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.3% in February, a slowdown from 0.5% in January, but ahead of forecasts for 0.2%.Earlier this week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) also came in faster than anticipated, with inflation ticking up to 3.2% annually and the core rate rising to 3.8%.Previously flirting with dipping below the 4% level earlier this month, the 10-year Treasury yield has new risen to 4.30%. Alongside, the U.S. dollar has broken out a downtrend begun in mid-February to rise about 1% over the past week, including a 0.5% rise on Thursday. All things being equal, higher rates and a rising dollar tend to be a negative for risk assets like bitcoin (BTC).Expectations for far easier monetary policy in 2024 continue to be whittled back. Markets had come into the year anticipating as much as 150 basis points in Fed rate cuts in 2024, with the initial cut to come at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. At this point, no one longer expects that, nor is a cut expected at the May meeting. As for June, the odds of lower rates have fallen to roughly 50%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.After about a 70% rise in 2024 to a new record high just shy of $74,000, bitcoin was surely vulnerable to a correction and it could be that the inflation, interest rate and dollar news has given traders an excuse to lighten up. After touching $73,800 earlier Thursday morning, bitcoin slid to as low as $70,650 after the economic data. At press time it was trading at $70,900 down more than 3% over the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by just 1.7%, with gains in Solana and Dogecoin helping that gauge's outperformance."

The ascent has taken the shape of a “rising wedge,” which is a bearish pattern, according to technical analysis theory.“Normally rising wedges resolve bearish,” crypto analyst and trader Josh Olszewicz told CoinDesk, explaining a possibility of a typical bull market pullback ahead.A rising wedge pattern comprises upward-sloping trendlines that connect highs and lows and converge toward a single point known as the apex. The converging nature of trendlines indicates a steady weakening of bullish momentum. Thus, an eventual wedge breakdown, or the move below the trendline connecting lows, represents a bearish development, paving the way for deeper price losses.Bitcoin's rising wedge pattern suggests a pullback ahead.

        "content": "The main news this week centers around today's Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, which marks the blockchain's biggest technical shift in over a year. As CoinDesk's Margaux Nijkerk reports, the upgrade could help slice fees for Ethereum users through \"proto-danksharding,\" an upgrade that's designed to optimize the network for layer 2 (L2) rollup networks like Optimism and Arbitrum. On the other hand, some developers warn that the shift could fragment the Ethereum ecosystem and set it down a path that risks costing it its competitive edge versus competing chains.In this week's issue of The Protocol:Developers are debating whether Dencun will be a good or a bad thing for the Ethereum network.Investors and builders are breathing new life into DePIN networks that merge the physical and blockchain worlds to deliver on crypto use cases.Legacy financial institutions like MasterCard, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are continuing their march into the blockchain domain through new crypto partnerships and pilot programs.Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Swell, Polygon, EigenLayer, Vega Protocol, Nibiru, Rarimo, Burnt Banksy, XION.Over $160 million of blockchain project fundraises.This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.Network newsETHEREUM UPGRADES: Ethereum's biggest upgrade in over a year has finally happened. The update, Dencun, contains a slate of code changes designed to improve Ethereum for developers and make it quicker and cheaper for end-users. The main one that people are paying attention to is \"proto-danksharding,\" which will allow abstract \"blobs\" of data to be posted to Ethereum alongside plain-old transactions. The idea of adding new lanes to the Ethereum highway via \"sharding\" is not a new one, but this first stab at the technique zeroes in specifically on decreasing fees for the \"layer 2\" chains that are rapidly becoming the primary venues by which people transact on Ethereum, which has seen its fees soar in recent years with rising network traffic. Developers hope the change will ramp up capacity on the network, allowing L2 blockchains like Arbitrum, Optimism and Coinbase's Base network to post larger volumes of data to Ethereum without paying an arm and a leg to do so. While blobs could help slice gas fees for L2 users, there remains some uncertainty around the extent to which proto-danksharding will ease the chain's fee woes: As any city planner will warn Ethereum's core developers, adding lanes to a highway (or \"shards\"/\"blobs\" to a blockchain) may not ease congestion as intended. Some developers have also voiced concern that Ethereum's embrace of L2s and native \"data availability\" risk fragmenting the ecosystem, and could lose the base chain its competitive edge versus rival networks.GOING DEEP IN ON DEPIN: Speeds are improving and fees are reducing across blockchains, but we're 15 years into the crypto \"revolution\" and few use cases have caught on outside of the narrow realms of memecoins and finance. One of the major trends helping to expand the crypto conversation beyond DeFi and infrastructure is \"decentralized physical infrastructure networks,\" or DePIN, which meld the physical world with blockchains to accomplish everything from easing supply chain inefficiencies to deploying unused compute resources. Projects that bridge blockchains with physical goods are nothing new: Helium, one of the more (in)famous examples of a DePIN project, is trying to create a wireless network that rewards contributors for setting up WiFi hubs. Filecoin, a veteran data-storage blockchain, rewards people for lending their unused hard drive space and remains a go-to example of how blockchain tech can solve real-world problems. The DePIN moniker was on the tip of everyone's tongue at last week's ETHDenver conference, but one might be tempted to wave it away as yet another marketing term meant to entice investors and users to tired ideas. But things have changed recently in the DePIN space, with improved blockchain tech and AI hype – buoyed by a surge in investor dollars – fueling the rise of newer projects like the compute-focused Akash and Render networks. If nothing else, the DePIN space is one to keep an eye on because it could help present an answer to an age-old question that has plagued crypto since its inception: Where are the use cases?ALSO:MetaMask, a leading crypto wallet, teams up with Mastercard to begin testing what it says will be the first blockchain-powered payment card.Kamino Finance revises the point-earning rules for its KMNO token airdrop in response to community backlash, promising additional rewards for long-term users, though the specifics of the changes remain undisclosed.Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon and more than a dozen other banks, custodians, and crypto firms are working with bluechip financial blockchain provider Digital Asset to pilot a program for tokenized asset transference and settlement.PancakeSwap, the decentralized exchange, unveils a new version that it says is designed to make trading more efficient.Protocol VillageTop picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.Ethereum staking protocol Swell has introduced a layer-2 rollup with $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) using Polygon's chain development kit (CDK). Swell developed the rollup alongside Ethereum scaler AltLayer and a16z-backed crypto staking project EigenLayer. The rollup will take the form of a \"restaked rollup,\" which comes with a range of services such as decentralized sequencing, verification and faster finality, Swell said on Wednesday.Vega Protocol, a purpose-built blockchain for decentralized derivatives trading, is launching the first futures markets for \"points,\" according to the team. The first markets are for EigenLayer points, with more expected soon. Vega uses UMA's Optimistic Oracle to resolve each points market at the time of the \"Airdrop Event,\" which triggers settlement and determines the price per point. Users can assert claims to the oracle, which are verified on-chain if undisputed. This decentralized framework enables complex market rulesets without relying on a single centralized custodian.NibiruChain, a layer-1 blockchain built by founders from Google, Tendermint, IBM and Sommelier, is announcing the launch of its public mainnet, according to the team: \"Nibiru aims to address users’ onboarding challenges and provide a fully mainstream decentralized multichain solution.

Debating Dencun: Will Ethereum's Big Update Help or Harm the Network?Ethereum Foundation's Tim Beiko joined The Protocol podcast to discuss the implications of the Dencun upgrade. (CoinDesk, modified using PhotoMosh)Ethereum's biggest update in over a year, Dencun, finally arrived on Wednesday after years of planning. It's seen as a good thing. But maybe not universally so.Proto-danksharding, the main change coming with the Dencun update (a portmanteau of two simultaneous updates: \"Deneb\" and \"Cancun\"), marks Ethereum's first step down the road of \"sharding,\" a method for increasing the chain's transaction capacity by adding new lanes to its proverbial blockchain highway.The feature is specifically aimed at reducing fees for layer 2 \"rollup\" networks – chains like Optimism, Arbitrum and Coinbase's Base network that run on top of Ethereum and offer users the ability to transact for cheap without leaving the ecosystem entirely.While many developers are celebrating Dencun for its potential to accelerate Ethereum towards improved affordability, others worry that it risks setting the ecosystem down a path that could, in the long run, come back to bite it.\"The Dencun upgrade is Ethereum’s response to clear needs for greater scalability,\" Rich Rines, an initial contributor at Core DAO, which develops blockchain infrastructure, said in a message to CoinDesk.

The main issue is a matter of jurisdiction; up until Sterlingov’s arrest in Los Angeles in April of 2021, the defendant hadn’t stepped foot in the U.S.It’s a strategy Ekeland employed in his first major win against the government — defending “Nazi troll” Andrew “Weev” Auernheimer, charged with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act after he exposed a massive security flaw in AT&T's website. Ekeland won on appeal after the court found the venue, the state of New Jersey, had no connection to Auernheimer or AT&T.“This is just the halfway point,” Ekeland said, noting that he expected and respected the jury’s verdict and that federal criminal win rates exceed 99%. Ekeland’s main argument is that the Department of Justice was able to bring the case after the IRS, which was involved in the decade-long investigation, contacted Bitcoin Fog customer service asking if it’d be a good platform to launder funds earned from selling drugs.“If the government can get criminal venue from what they did in this case, that means that any prosecutor in the f***ing United States can sit down at their computer in Podunkville, do a transaction on your website and then criminally charge you in the place that they do it,” he said. That “blows a hole in the venue clause” set up by the U.S. Constitution.See also: When Did Privacy Become a Bad Word? | OpinionAdding to this issue is that Ekeland and his partner on the case Mike Hassard, a friend of Sterlingov, filed motions to dismiss the case and for presiding District Judge Randolph Moss to clarify the “venue issue” that were only answered “from the bench” the day the trial began. “There's a gigantic venue issue … and I can kind of tell that the judge knew” that.There are other issues Ekeland intends to raise when he files a notice of appeal after Sterlingov’s sentencing this summer having to do with what the government was allowed to enter into evidence versus the defense and other “shaddy” background issues that may cast doubt on the decision.“I mean, we got [into evidence] that [Sterlingov] was in jail, when Bitcoin Fog took his last withdrawal,” he said. However, there are other issues about the site’s operations and sunsetting that occurred when Sterlingov could not have had access to the servers, Ekeland noted. More importantly, Ekeland said that the government never conclusively showed Sterlingov ever operated or profited from the site — he was just an early user.“The flow of funds is not the same as flow of control,” Ekeland said, discussing a particular series of transactions supposedly linking Sterlingov to Bitcoin Fog’s domain name registrar. He suggested that in 2011 Sterlingov, who had supported his lifestyle by trading bitcoin, sold bitcoin to the people who started Bitcoin Fog.This is a point J.W. Verret, an associate professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, raised in a Cointelegraph op-ed, noting “Sterlingov may have sold Bitcoin to someone who bought the Bitcoin Fog website, or that someone may have later sold Bitcoin to someone who then sold it to someone else.”Matt Price, who participated in the government’s investigation of Bitcoin Fog while with the IRS Criminal Investigation team and who now leads strategic engagement at on-chain analysis firm Elliptic, disagrees. “The evidence linking to that transaction was very clear — we had source information, I've seen the records. That was not the most complicated tracing I've ever done.”See also: Privacy Is a Human Right | OpinionIt’s a significant point considering that much of the criminal defense hinged on discrediting the notion of on-chain analysis — particularly that of Chainalysis’ Reactor software used by numerous government agencies around the world. In one of the pre-trial hearings, which ended up totalling over 1,800 pages of records, Ekeland referred to Chainalysis’ software as “junk science.”In particular, in a lengthy pretrial debate, there were concerns the software had not been “peer-reviewed” or scientifically accredited and could generate false positives. This ended up not mattering much in court: Judge Moss said he was “unpersuaded” by the defense’s stance that blockchain analytics is faulty.“Substantial evidence supports the government’s submission that the software is highly reliable—and, if anything, conservative,” Moss wrote in a 31-page pre-trial order.This may cycle back to the appeals case Ekeland is building: In August, Jonelle Still, director of investigations and intelligence at competitor analysis firm CipherTrace, submitted a 41-page expert report claiming Chainalysis used “unverifiable” and “incomplete” techniques to incorrectly link Sterlingov to Bitcoin Fog. Mastercard, which bought CipherTrace in 2021, later spiked the report.“We lost our tracing expert right before the trial,” Ekeland said, adding “we never got a really clear reason why.”For its part, a Chainalysis representative said over email that “the decision directly dismisses concerns around error rate, peer review or testing,” adding those issues are hardly “relevant to the underlying technology.” It was a point Price agreed with, saying the argument “fell flat with the jury.”Questions about blockchain analysis to one side, Price said his investigations while at the IRS were “old fashioned manual police work.” The case took a decade to build, “we were all over traveling around the world, taking all kinds of different investigative steps, reviewing records, using every tool at our disposal,” he said.While Price said the average crypto user has every right to preserve their financial privacy, he noted that Bitcoin Fog’s website, corporate and social media communications and branding suggested it was actively soliciting funds from criminal enterprises.“Privacy is a fine line. If you're not taking any steps whatsoever to prevent child sexual abuse material, darknet markets, ransomware, the Bitfenix hack, things of that nature for using your service, you're actually, in my mind, as bad or worse than the people involved in the actual illicit activity,” Price said.See also: Man Who Laundered Billions in Bitcoins From Bitfinex Says He Used Bitcoin FogMany people in the crypto industry — whether or not it accepts Sterlingov’s guilty verdict — would likely disagree. Crypto operates on the principle of credible neutrality, the idea that protocols should not be able to discriminate against or censor users, just as a dollar bill does not care who uses it. And, perhaps unfortunately, the only way to ensure that platforms remain accessible for all is to ensure they can also facilitate the worst actors.Ekeland might see that as a frightening prospect, but a wrongful conviction based on “circumstantial” evidence as worse.“I think this is really scary for anyone involved in bitcoin,\" he said of TK. \"The underlying assumptions that people were making about the traces is essentially that the flow of funds equals the flow of control.”"

        "content": "Long-standing and generally accepted financial theory shows that diversification is not only good, but improves expected returns per unit of risk.Unfortunately, the crypto space currently seems to be overlooking this principle.A “TradFi” EquivalentA timely post from the quantitative asset management firm AQR provides a direct \"TradFi\" equivalent to the problem of under-diversification. In the post, AQR co-founder and CIO Cliff Asness rebuffs a recent paper that effectively poses the question, \"Why not 100% equities?\" — a style of thinking that tends to resurface during bull markets.You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.The blog recounts certain tenets of introductory financial theory, largely amounting to \"owning one asset is suboptimal\":“In finance 101 we are taught that in general we should separate the choice of 1) what is the best return-for-risk portfolio?, and 2) what risk we should take? This new paper, and many like it, confuse the two. If the best return-for-risk portfolio doesn’t have enough expected return for you, then you lever it (within reason). If it has too much risk for you, you de-lever it with cash. Remarkably this has been shown to work.”Asness harkens back to the basics of modern portfolio theory to show that you can own a single asset, but don't expect that one asset to outperform a portfolio of diversified (i.e., not perfectly correlated) assets on a risk-adjusted basis.Does Diversification Matter for Crypto?Crypto investors should ask themselves a similar question: why not 100% Bitcoin?Given Bitcoin's outsized media attention, market commentators often still equate \"crypto\" with \"Bitcoin.\" The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs may be an important first step toward broad-based investor adoption, but a conspicuous departure from the golden rule of diversification has emerged.Let's examine four hypothetical crypto portfolios going back to 2018: Bitcoin Only and Ethereum Only (no diversification), an equal-weighted allocation to Bitcoin and Ethereum (a little diversification), and a passively weighted portfolio of the top 10 non-stablecoin assets in any given month (better diversification).The bottom line: diversification matters for crypto.The Bitcoin Only and Ethereum Only portfolios produced highly similar annualized returns of about ~30%, but Ethereum Only exhibited higher volatility, resulting in worse risk-adjusted performance compared to Bitcoin. Annualized returns of this magnitude may satisfy \"Bitcoin Bulls\" and \"Ethereum Maximalists,” but could investors construct more efficient portfolios? Yes.By combining Bitcoin and Ethereum in a simple equal-weighted basket of the two assets, we observe notably improved risk-adjusted returns. Compared to Bitcoin Only, the annualized risk increases somewhat but the increase in return is greater than the increase in volatility, resulting in superior risk-adjusted performance. If the slight increase in risk vs. Bitcoin Only wasn't acceptable to an investor, the investor could hold some cash alongside the portfolio to dampen volatility while still achieving better returns.Adding more assets to the portfolio improved risk-adjusted returns even further. With a passively weighted, monthly rebalanced portfolio of the top-10 assets by circulating market capitalization, annualized volatility effectively remained constant compared to the equal-weighted BTC-ETH portfolio, while annualized returns increased meaningfully.Broadening the digital asset universe to better capture the value proposition of differentiated blockchain technologies improved the portfolio's risk-adjusted return characteristics.ConclusionDespite crypto's brief and volatile history, recent evidence suggests what traditional markets have repeatedly demonstrated: owning a single asset delivers worse risk-adjusted returns over the long-term compared to a portfolio of diversified assets.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."

That’s significantly lower than the last bull run, which bred over 4,000 millionaire wallets per day and over 2,000 wallets with a $10 million balance per day.The slower pace might mean the bull run is still in the early stages, and the pace of inflows is yet to peak. The conclusion is consistent with market consensus that prices could rise to $150,000 and higher in the coming months due to continued inflows into the spot ETFs and the impending halving-induced supply reduction.“This [slower growth rate of millionaires] could be due to a few things: (1) New capital has yet to arrive in full force.

Many of the paper’s reporters and editors have been staunch critics of crypto, and take any opportunity to write negative articles or post self-satisfied statements when things go awry in crypto, which is often.Nowhere is this more apparent than on Alphaville, the FT’s erudite daily markets blog, which could be read as standing for the general (but unofficial) view of the paper. Here is a sampling of headlines Alphaville published over the past four years pertaining to crypto:Little evidence that a spot bitcoin ETF would expand the market(Boy, did they get that one wrong.)Let crypto burn(Charming.)How stablecoins are destabilising crypto(A Tether crisis think piece.)Why bitcoin is worse than a Madoff-style Ponzi scheme(Madoff was pretty bad.)Oh no, now Deloitte with the crypto nonsense(Godforbid companies take an interest in ascendent technology.)The crypto Buffett lunch has been postponed. Lucky Warren Buffett.(They may have gotten this one right.)Notably, former Alphaville editor Izabella Kaminska had a change of heart on Bitcoin in 2020 and ultimately quit the FT two years later (for a number of reasons). She wrote at the time “part of me has always thought of the crypto market as a type of honeytrap for the worst irrational exuberance emerging from the quantitative easing and zirp [Zero Interest-Rate Policy] era.”While the growing appreciation for Bitcoin among the tastemakers and power brokers of the world doesn’t necessarily translate to support for crypto across the board (a point-of-view that could be considered as Bitcoin Maximalism Light), it does open the doors to more people thinking more seriously about blockchain technology.In other words, crypto is becoming destigmatized. Time will tell how far this will filter up within elite circles — it likely hangs on bitcoin’s continued success. But I can imagine a day where the default position isn’t to sneer, jeer or steer clear of bitcoin and instead view it as part of the financial furniture.Enter Donald Trump, who called crypto a “scam” in 2021 but told CNBC this weekend he has been having “fun” with crypto and called bitcoin an “additional form of currency.” These are not the first positive comments Trump has made as his presidential campaign ramps up, suggesting he no longer sees crypto as a threat towards his “America First” agenda or considers it cut from the same populist cloth.Further, even if people aren’t out-and-out Bitcoin or crypto supporters, the number of people willing to criticize the industry appears to be dwindling.There are a number of factors influencing this shift, including the successful launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. Not only did this prove there was intense pent up demand for bitcoin exposure but also that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s years of fear mongering about potential market manipulation was misplaced.More importantly perhaps, as Sharma’s op-ed suggests, it seems like these elite folks are tired of being wrong. There are only so many supposed Bitcoin autopsies that can be written before critics have to examine their own heads.Of course, whether or not people in high places begrudgingly accept that it’s not disappearing doesn’t matter much. Crypto still has its flaws. The hope is that, with fewer people trodding out the same tired arguments to be debunked, the quality of industry criticism will rise.Sharma himself, while accepting that bitcoin is a viable investment, still has his reservations. He noted that bitcoin isn’t being used much as a currency and that the idea that it’ll become “‘digital gold’ [is] still a dream.” He’s not wrong that bitcoin isn’t commonly being used to buy coffee by anyone but fanatics, but he does contradict himself.See also: The European Central Bank Is Either Lying About Bitcoin or to Itself | OpinionHe notes 70% of addresses have been inactive for longer than a year because people buy and hold bitcoin, but that’s because buyers treat it as a store-of-value. Bitcoin may not have gold’s market cap today, but what exactly is standing in its way? Just today, with Bitcoin’s market cap crossing $1.4 trillion, it reached parity with silver.Nothing is off the table for Bitcoin. It can continue to rally, trade sideways for months or ratchet back down. It’s likely not hitting zero, considering there’s a growing group of Bitcoiners willing to buy at any price (people who perhaps a month ago Sharma would have called the greater fool.)Whether you invest or not in Bitcoin, it pays not to bet against it surprising you."

He also expects bitcoin to divert money away from other risk assets, including the giant SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and for bitcoin to begin showing up in other funds similar to the BlackRock setting plans to acquire spot BTC ETFs in its Global Allocation Fund.Bitcoin on Monday became the world’s eighth most valuable asset, surpassing silver as its market cap rose above $1.4 trillion. It has a long way to go before it reaches the value of gold, which stands at a whopping $14.7 trillion valuation.Saylor reminded of the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April, which will reduce the crypto's block reward by 50%, meaning just 450 new bitcoins hitting the market each day from the current 900. “The price of bitcoin is going to have to adjust up in order to meet that investor demand.”Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) on Monday announced that it had bought 12,000 more bitcoin for just over $800 million, bringing its holdings to 205,000 tokens.

Still, these support drivers are “likely to meet some important macro and technical headwinds in the weeks ahead,” the authors wrote.The Federal Reserve is expected to let the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which was used to support U.S. regional banks, expire on March 11, the report said, adding that “this may close an arbitrage opportunity for banks but at the expense of potentially re-introducing vulnerabilities into the financial system.”Additionally, the note said that a drop in fund managers’ cash reserves coupled with quarter-end rebalancing may tie up liquidity.Due to these offsetting dynamics, Coinbase said the most likely scenario is for bitcoin to trade inside a narrow range until the “next idiosyncratic event - the bitcoin halving in mid-April.” The quadrennial reward halving will cut bitcoin mining rewards by 50%.Coinbase notes that exchange-traded funds have changed bitcoin’s market dynamics, undermining the usefulness of studying previous halving cycles. “The cumulative net growth in BTC held by ETFs has outpaced that generated by miners by nearly threefold,” the report added.Read more: Bitcoin Is Unlikely to Match Gold’s Allocation in Investors’ Portfolios in Nominal Terms: JPMorganEdited by Parikshit Mishra."

It further supports the evidence of retail inflow,” Park added.The \"Kimchi premium\" refers to the difference in Bitcoin prices on Korean exchanges compared to global bourses.

Reuters report added that the bank could ditch the bond-buying program after ending the negative interest rate policy.Some analysts have long warned that BOJ is a major source of uncertainty for both traditional and crypto markets.Since 2016, the BOJ’s NIRP and bond-buying program have been a major source of downward pressure for global government bond yields, helping support asset prices. The central bank maintained a pro-liquidity stance over the past two years even as its peers, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, raised rates rapidly to combat inflation.However, the BOJ is now under pressure to raise rates, thanks to domestic inflation running well above its target and the rising probability of wage hikes. The Japanese yen is rising, boasting a 2% weekly gain against the U.S. dollar at press time.The potential unwinding of BOJ’s pro-liquidity stance and resulting yen strength will likely jeopardize the yen carry trade, which may have greased the ongoing year-long risk-on rally in financial markets, including technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. A carry trade involves borrowing low-interest fiat like the yen and investing in high-yielding.Crypto bulls might want to monitor a potential BOJ-led decline in stocks, particularly shares in technology firms. That’s because, as in previous bull runs, bitcoin’s latest move to record highs has coincided with the outperformance of rate-sensitive technology stocks relative to the broader U.S. equity market. The ratio between Wall Street’s tech-heavy index, Nasdaq (NDX), and the S&P 500 (SPX) rose to record highs in January.That said, the consensus in the crypto market is that any dip in bitcoin is likely to be short-lived, and prices could rally into six figures in the coming months.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Meanwhile, the most recent public statements from MicroStrategy show the company as of Feb. 26 held 193,000 tokens.It's possible that MicroStrategy has added to that total since, as the company earlier this week priced a $700 million capital raise with intentions to use the funds to purchase more bitcoin.Since the launch of the spot ETFs on Jan. 11, BlackRock's IBIT has often added hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin on a daily basis, establishing itself as the largest of the new spot products (excepting the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which was converted from a closed end fund).Next in line for IBIT would be Grayscale's GBTC, which has lost more than 200,000 bitcoin since the spot products opened for business, but still holds around 400,000 tokens.Massive demand for the new spot ETFs is the key reason for bitcoin’s more than 60% price surge this year. The cryptocurrency topped $70,000 for the first time ever Friday morning, eventually reaching a fresh all-time high of $70,136, according to data from CoinDesk Indices. At press time, bitcoin was trading at just under the $70,000 mark.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Traditional markets for now are showing little reaction to the new numbers, with U.S. equity futures, bond yields and the dollar modestly lower.Coming into 2024, markets had been anticipating slowdowns in the economy and inflation to result in a fast pace of rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve. To this point, though, the economy remains resilient and inflation stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. As a result, expectations for the first Fed easing have moved from March to June, or even later and participants have now priced only about 75 basis points in rate cuts this year versus roughly 150 just several weeks ago.Disappointment about easier Fed policy, however, hasn't translated into any difficulty in asset markets, where the major U.S. stock averages and the price of gold are all at or near all-time highs.

Gold is the best comparison for the cryptocurrency given investor perception of bitcoin as a digital version of the metal, the report said. “Most investors take risk and volatility into account when they allocate across asset classes and given the volatility in bitcoin is around 3.7 times the volatility of gold it would be unrealistic to expect bitcoin to match gold within investors’ portfolios in notional amounts,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.Optimism Foundation said on Friday that it entered into a private token sale of approximately 19.5 million OP tokens, worth nearly $90 million at current prices, to an undisclosed buyer.

The strike price is almost three times bitcoin’s going market rate of $67,000.Of the total tally, $14.6 million is locked in the $200,000 call expiring on Dec. 27, while the rest is concentrated in June and September expiry strikes, according to data source Deribit Metrics.Theoretically, buying the so-called deep out-of-the-money (OTM) call at the $200,000 strike expiring on Dec. 31 is a bet that the cryptocurrency will end the year above that level.Call options give investors the right to buy the underlying asset at a set price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. The notional open interest refers to the U.S. dollar value locked in the active options contracts at a given time. On Deribit, the leading crypto options exchange, one options contract represents one BTC.The $200,000 strike call was quite popular the last time bitcoin traded above $60,000 in 2021.The latest interest in the deep OTM strike is consistent with the consensus that BTC’s impending halving-induced supply reduction will further skew the supply-demand imbalance in favor of the bulls, eventually pushing prices into six figures.The supply-demand balance recently grew to 1:10, thanks to Wall Street’s embrace of the U.S.-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin tapped fresh record highs above $69,000 early this week and last changed hands near $67,000, representing a 59.7% year-to-date gain. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, has gained 45%.The rally has boosted the overall activity in the options market. On Deribit, total open interest in bitcoin options has soared to a record $20.4 billion, surpassing the previous peak of $14.36 billion in October 2021. Similarly, ether’s (ETH) options open interest has jumped to a lifetime high of $11.66 billion.Deep OTM calls are cheaper than those at strikes closer to and below the going market rate. Thus, outright purchases of deep OTM calls are often considered analogous to lottery tickets. The loss is limited to the extent of the premium paid to purchase the option, but, in theory, profit can be huge if the market exceeds the strike price before expiry.Open interest has hit a new record high.

Under the settlement, BlockFi will receive a total of $874.5 million in claims against the two companies. $250 million will be treated as a secured claim, which will prioritize payment to BlockFi after FTX's plan to end bankruptcy, filed December, is approved by its creditors. In turn, FTX will drop its claims against BlockFi, allowing the lender's remaining claims to be paid out like other similar claims under FTX's plan according to the settlement.

For one, as Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal explained in Wednesday's newsletter, the crypto community has been focused on market flows rather than narratives about how decentralized finance or Web3 will revolutionize traditional finance.Another factor that makes this rally stand out is that prices have surged despite signs of strength in the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields, as opposed to 2020-21, when both were weakening.One thing, however, remains the same. As in previous bull runs, the latest surge is accompanied by optimism directed toward technology stocks on Wall Street, characterized by a gain in the ratio between the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index and the broader S&P 500, the NDX-SPX ratio.Since early 2017, bitcoin and the ratio have moved in lockstep through rallies and declines, with the ratio hitting record highs a couple of weeks before the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin's move this week to record highs above $69,000 comes after the NDX-SPX ratio set a new lifetime high of 3.6 in late January. The pattern is similar to the one seen in 2020-21.The positive correlation, clearly visible on the chart below, suggests that the inflow of money into cryptocurrencies, an emerging technology, is at least partly contingent on, or at least reflects, optimism regarding the outlook for technology stocks relative to the broader equities market.Over the years, bitcoin has closely tracked the Nasdaq-to-S&P 500 ratio. (TradingView) (TradingView)According to charting platform TradingView, the 52-week correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the NDX-SPX ratio stood above 0.60 at press time. The correlation has been mostly positive since early 2017. A positive correlation indicates that both variables are moving in the same direction.Note how BTC peaked with the NDX-SPX ratio in late 2021. Both entered a bear market in subsequent months, eventually bottoming out in December 2022.That means traders looking for signs of bitcoin's path forward might want to keep a close eye on the NDX-SPX ratio. Relative weakness in technology stocks might weigh on bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market.The consensus in the crypto market is that bitcoin's impending halving-induced supply reduction and the increased demand from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will put the cryptocurrency on a path to $150,000 and higher.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "Bitcoin’s (BTC) all-time high of $69,325 has not been hedged for inflation — a dint in the idea that this “digital gold” is a successful store-of-value. When measuring inflation, bitcoin, despite its notable rally in recent months, is still technically worth less than it was at its previous high in November 2021.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteAccording to the U.S. inflation calculator, the cost of a single BTC today — at around $67,000 at time of writing, would need to hit $78,905.45 to claim the same value as bitcoin in 2021, the year it last saw a record high. Of course, this could be more of an indictment of the U.S. dollar than bitcoin, which has rallied over 230% year-over-year.Put differently, bitcoin’s market peak set this week would have the same purchase value as $60,907 in 2021, $55,097.30 in 2017 and $52,363.34 in 2013 — years which saw significant price appreciation for the first cryptocurrency.See also: Bitcoin Soars to a Record – but What's the Price?That a volatile asset like bitcoin hasn’t kept up with inflation (at least since the last ATH) is a bit of a red herring when considering how far it has come. A bitcoin in someone’s wallet today, for instance, would be worth $48,395.13 in 2008, when it was first launched and didn’t have a market value at all. Bitcoin first hit parity with the U.S. dollar in February 2011, and has been gaining ever since.The current rally — spurred by the successful launch of spot market bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other contributing factors — has cemented in people’s minds that crypto is not going away, even if it doesn’t continue to climb. The list of people willing to state that bitcoin is dead is shrinking, and its roster of backers is only growing.Moreover, bitcoin hit earlier fresh all-time highs outside of the U.S. — in the E.U., Japan, Turkey, and so on — given the rate of currency depreciation relative to the dollar. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has gained 10.7% since November 2021, meaning many currencies across the world have lost value.One of the biggest value propositions of Bitcoin is the idea that it will hold its value better than fiat currencies. While the Federal Reserve seems to have steered an economy ravished by a pandemic-led global shutdown towards a “soft landing,” many have still lost faith in the ability for technocrats to manage U.S. finances. All in, the U.S. government printed $13 trillion during COVID alone, which has shown up in increased prices for consumer goods.Interestingly, bitcoin is ratcheting up alongside physical gold, which crypto researcher Nicole Acheson attributes to increased buying pressure from central banks around the world. “The World Gold Council reported that central banks increased official gold reserves by 39 tonnes in January, more than double the net increase seen in December,” she wrote in the “Crypto Is Macro” newsletter, noting Turkey, China, India and Kazakhstan are leading the purchases.See also: Bitcoin's Test of All-Time Highs Means Old Miners Are SellingIt’s hard to say how bitcoin will perform over the long haul, but, psychologically, many holders feel secure that the network will be capped at 21 million coins — in theory — which could be called a more predictable and potentially deflationary “monetary policy.” This is all the more relevant given how well bitcoin has performed during a period of raised interest rates, which most analysts thought would depress crypto prices.Bitcoin has appreciated more than 50% year-to-date alone, setting an all-time high just weeks after bitcoin ETFs were launched during a period of severe market pessimism. It’s not out of the question for it to climb another $10,000 and surpass its inflation-adjusted price. Either way, the real value of bitcoin shouldn’t be its price in dollars, but what you could do with it."

(Sam Kessler)ETHEREUM'S BIG TENT: Ethereum conferences aren't just for Ethereans anymore, CoinDesk's Sam Kessler reports. Last week's ETHDenver conference in Colorado, one of the year's largest gatherings for developers and users of the Ethereum blockchain, drew in a cross-section of the blockchain industry. The broad swath of attendees might be a testament to Ethereum's influence on other blockchain ecosystems, attracting onlookers from other crypto tribes. But it also might be a sign of rival systems looking to encroach on Ethereum's success in making blockchains more programmable, with its vibrant ecosystem of software developers looking to create new applications. Bitcoin, in the midst of a developer renaissance with the advent of its own NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) services, had an impressive turnout of builders at the conference. So did Polkadot, the \"hub-and-spoke\" blockchain created by Gavin Wood, an Ethereum co-founder who used to market his new project as an improvement over the Ethereum model. Even Solana, the speed-focused network that's long positioned itself as an \"ETH Killer,\" had a well-attended booth at Denver's National Western Complex, the conference's venue. John Paller, the conference's founder and executive steward, told CoinDesk in an interview that there were \"probably seven or eight layer 1s that are here, and we have probably 12 layer 2s.\" According to conference officials, there were 20,000 \"festival attendees.\"BITCOIN PSA: In last week's issue, we highlighted how, despite robust demand to buy bitcoin by newly approved U.S. spot ETFs, and the surging BTC price (this week surpassing the previous all-time high around $69,000), the governance of the blockchain's software is still dependent on largely volunteers, or on pro developers moonlighting – a labor of love, as it were. And the process is down to having only one editor, Luke Dashjr, to manage what he described as the \"thankless and boring job\" of handling all the new Bitcoin Improvement Proposals or \"BIPs\" that come over the transom. Well, his cries for help were heard, apparently. Ava Chow, one of the maintainers of Bitcoin Core, acknowledged in a post on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list that it might be \"prudent for us to look at adding more BIPs editors.\" According to Chow: \"this would significantly help get through the backlog of BIPs PRs, and responding to them in a timely manner to significantly reduce the friction of getting BIPs changes merged,\" adding that \"any new BIP editors should be people who have a history of following and being involved in Bitcoin development, as well as being known to evaluate proposals objectively, and of course, are willing to do the job.\" As Bitcoin Optech newsletter put it dryly, \"No clear resolution has been reached.\"ALSO:Independent U.S. presidential candidate Robert F.

But How Much?Steven Goldfeder, CEO of Offchain Labs, the primary developer behind Arbitrum, spoke last week at the ETHDenver conference. (Danny Nelson)Ethereum developers are gearing up for the blockchain's next big upgrade happening next week, called Dencun.It's supposed to issue in a new era of lower costs for \"layer-2\" blockchains, including so-called rollup networks that aim to offer faster and cheaper transactions than on the main blockchain. But just how much lower?Dencun will be the biggest upgrade – technically a \"hard fork\" in blockchain parlance – that the network will undergo in almost a year.The main component in Dencun is called EIP-4844, or more commonly “proto-danksharding,” which will bring in a new type of transaction class that reduces the costs of publishing data of transactions on rollups, through the introduction of data “blobs.” These blobs are a separate place in a transaction where rollup networks or other protocols could temporarily stash data – sometimes described as a \"side car\" that doesn't take up space in the main car.As a result of more blobs, the costs for these layer-2 networks to stash data on Ethereum will be significantly cheaper, and the reduction is likely to trickle down to users in the form of lower fees.But how exactly it will all shake out is still ambiguous, according to many Ethereum experts. We asked leading layer-2 teams, including Polygon, Arbitrum, StarkWare and Coinbase's Base, for their predictions post-Dencun.Click here for the full interview by Margaux NijkerkMoney CenterFundraisingsSahara, the latest startup to blend the worlds of crypto and artificial intelligence, says it can help workers and companies get compensated for their knowledge, expertise and data in the age of AI.

        "content": "Bitcoin's latest all-time high on Tuesday morning was accelerated by the launch of the spot bitcoin ETFs, experts said.The cryptocurrency started its rally in earnest in the fall of 2023 as it became clearer that the funds would soon be approved.Experts said that it would've reached a new all-time high nevertheless, but the ETFs have been an important tailwind.Bitcoin (BTC) reached a highly anticipated new all-time high above $69,000 on Tuesday only two months after the approval and launch of the ten spot bitcoin ETFs. The fast timeline has left people wondering: would the new high have happened so soon if the ETFs hadn’t launched?No, according to Seth Ginns, managing partner and head of liquid investments at CoinFund. “The new all-time high would have happened without the ETFs, but we’ve likely accelerated this cycle with the ETF flows,” he said.Even with Grayscale's GBTC losing more than 200,000 from its bitcoin holdings since the ETF launches in January, the spot funds on a net basis have accumulated just shy of 163,000 tokens, according to data from BitMEX. BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC alone hold more than 196,000 bitcoins.“I definitely think the introduction of the ETF was a significant tailwind and, without it, we wouldn’t be at all time highs,” said Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services and a veteran futures and options trader.Iuorio believes that the recent rally is not just ETF-driven, but rooted just as much in the current political landscape, including anticipation that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s will lower benchmark interest rates in the coming months, as well as the end of the Bank Term Funding Program – an emergency platform put in place by the Fed in 2023 to stem what threatened to turn into a banking crisis.“The bid in all of crypto is a “no confidence” vote for the stewardship of fiat currencies and the potential for the Fed to restart quantitative easing and accommodative policy to assist in a pinch,” said Iuorio.In addition to the roughly 50% rally in bitcoin since the ETFs came online in January, much of the token's near-tripling in price in 2023 came after BlackRock in June indicated its intention to open a spot fund and Grayscale was victorious in its court case challenging the SEC's rejection of its spot ETF hopes.“While there are likely multiple factors driving the price of bitcoin right now, there is no question ETFs are playing a starring role,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. “The convenience of the ETF wrapper has unlocked a significant new source of demand in the form of retail investors, advisors, and institutional investors who didn’t want to hassle with buying bitcoin directly from crypto exchanges.”Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesBitcoin pushed to a record high on Tuesday, briefly rising above $69,000 on Coinbase, a level first touched on Nov. 10, 2021. The all-time high didn’t last long however; the world’s largest cryptocurrency has since retreated to around $67,000. There was a market-wide sell-off to as low as $60,800 and more than $1 billion in liquidations amid the volatility. Bitcoin rebounded in Asian morning hours, indicating resilience. Some observers said the selling pressure was likely driven by profit-taking at historical highs and miners offloading some of their bitcoin holdings. Institutional crypto exchange LMAX Digital said in a morning note that the record sets the stage for a push toward $100,000. LMAX also noted that a deeper correction should not be ruled out. “As far as setbacks go, we expect any meaningful setbacks will be exceptionally well supported on dips, with the $50,000 area now seen as a formidable support zone,” said LMAX. “It’s possible there are some quick drops below $50,000. But any such dips should be short-lived.”The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) effort last year to freeze Binance.US’ operations via a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) led to mass layoffs at the company as revenue imploded and it struggled with market trust, one of its executives said during a court deposition. “In the immediate aftermath of the TRO, we saw somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 billion of assets flee the platform, crypto, and fiat,” Christopher Blodgett, a Binance.US executive, said during a December 2023 deposition that was recently published as part of a status update on the SEC-Binance lawsuit. This loss of assets led to a 75% slump in revenue and 200 layoffs – two-thirds of the workforce – at the U.S.-incorporated arm of Binance. This headcount reduction has affected the exchange’s ability to respond to discovery requests from the SEC because teams are stretched thin.Revolut has joined forces with self-custodial wallet MetaMask to offer Revolut Ramp, a feature that will let users top up their MetaMask wallets with their Revolut account. The digital bank will enable users to make crypto purchases directly into MetaMask wallets in the U.K. and European Economic Area (EEA), an attempt to make adding crypto to self-custody wallets easier. Customers can use their fiat currency account balances or pay with Visa or Mastercard cards. \"This partnership is really about giving our users what they want – more control over their crypto, in a straightforward way, using platforms they already know and trust,\" said Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at MetaMask developer Consensys.Chart of the DayOn Tuesday, bitcoin trading volume on centralized exchanges rose to $46.25 billion, the highest since 2021, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko.An uptick in trading volume often improves market depth or the ability to absorb large buy/sell order prices at stable prices.Source: Kaiko- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsBitcoin Rally May Slow as Order-Book Imbalance Hints at Profit TakingEuropean Crypto Exchange Bitstamp Receives In-Principle Approval in SingaporeCrypto Funding Rates Reset After Bitcoin's Sharp Pullback From $69KEdited by Sheldon Reback."

The gap between the total dollar value of orders to sell bitcoin, the so-called ask side, and orders to buy, the bid side, within 2% of the market price has widened to nearly $100 million, according to Paris-based Kaiko. That's about five times its usual value.Moreover, there has been relatively more liquidity on the ask side, representing potential supply to the market, since late January, a sign investors have been looking to sell on the rise. Bitcoin has surged almost 60% since the start of the year.\"The current mismatch is notable because the 2% BTC ask depth has surpassed the bid depth for the longest period since early 2021 (when our data starts). It typically suggests building of limit orders on the sell side of the order book and could mean that traders are taking profit as BTC nears its all-time high,\" Dessislava Aubert, a research analyst at Kaiko, said in an email.Bitcoin tapped fresh record highs above $69,000 on Tuesday before sliding back and then rebounding. It was recently changing hands at $66,700, little changed on a 24-hour basis. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, was down 1.5% at 2,553.Bitcoin: 2% bid vs ask depth. (Kaiko) (Kaiko)Market makers could be partly responsible for the imbalance in order book numbers, Aubert said. Market makers agree to provide liquidity to the order book and are always on the opposite side of investors' trades. They are constantly hedging their exposure to maintain a direction-neutral portfolio.\"We also observe a strong increase in demand and net buying on most exchanges over the past days, so it [the imbalance] could be related to market makers positioning,\" Aubert said.The chart below shows the cumulative volume delta (CVD) on major spot exchanges since Feb. 25. A positive and rising CVD indicates a net buying pressure, while a negative CVD suggests the opposite. CVD on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume traded, has grown by nearly $1 billion since that date. Other exchanges have also contributed to the net buying pressure in the market.Binance has led the growth in the CVD since Feb. 25, indicating a net buying pressure in the market.

The correction led to the forced closure of $1 billion worth of leveraged perpetual futures bets across digital asset markets.The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a broader market gauge, rose to a high of $2,627 on Tuesday and has since pulled back to $2,496.Since then, the annualized funding rates or the cost of holding leveraged bets in perpetual futures tied to the top 25 cryptocurrencies have reset to less than 20%, down significantly from triple-digit figures observed a few days ago.In other words, the overheated perpetual futures market has cooled, opening doors for a more long-lasting move to record highs. Funding rates surged above 100% early this week as bitcoin’s strong bullish momentum saw investors jump in with both feet, using leveraged products to maximize gains.Exchanges use the funding rate mechanism to keep perpetuals prices aligned with spot prices. A positive funding rate indicates that perpetuals are trading at a premium to the spot price, indicating increased demand for bullish bets. As such, a high funding rate, as seen early this week, is said to reflect over-optimism, often observed at interim market tops.Funding rates have normalized with bitcoin's overnight price pullback.

While many people will point to the fact that the sell-off that ensued post-November 2021 (and previously after April 2021) was due to bad players in the market, I would argue that, while it may have been precipitated by the bad players, the sell-off was due to people being over-leveraged with unrealistic expectations for a straight-line appreciation to $100,000,” Glover said in an email.“I believe that we are back in that same situation and we will see a correction back to the mid-to-low $40,000 area in the coming weeks.

Investors worldwide who couldn't buy bitcoin from exchanges due to restrictions could buy mining stocks to gain exposure. That helped fuel the giant rally during the last bull market cycle in 2021.Unsurprisingly, these stocks slumped significantly during the subsequent bear market and some high-profile miners filed for bankruptcy, too. As the industry emerged from the brutal crypto winter and miners cleaned up their issues, there were hopes that their share prices would recover amid a bitcoin rally. But something else happened: Bitcoin's price is up about 54% this year and just hit an all-time high above $69,000, while the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), a fund that tracks the performance of publicly traded miners, fell about 21%.This disconnect between BTC and mining stocks gave investors a somber reminder that this bull run is different.The main driver of the rally in bitcoin, this time around, was the Securities and Exchange Commission this year approving spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S.Just like the miners' stocks, these ETFs trade on stock exchanges – accessible to just about any American brokerage account. This enabled investors to gain more direct exposure to the digital asset without having to buy them through separate accounts at crypto exchanges. This also ensured that they could hold bitcoin without having to expose their portfolio to the volatile nature of the mining stocks and their corporate risks.\"With the approval of Bitcoin ETF products, investors can now access direct exposure to bitcoin price. Prior to the approval of the ETF, public mining stocks were one of the only traditional vehicles through which investors could get exposure to bitcoin price appreciation,\" Galaxy's mining analysts, led by Brandon Bailey, wrote in a research note.It's possible that retail investors may still buy into mining stocks, but for institutional players – the ones that move the needle in most cases – short-selling mining stocks became the preferred trade. \"Institutions are seemingly more likely in the short run to go long the Bitcoin ETFs and short mining stocks, which we've seen start to play out since the beginning of 2024,\" the report added.Unless the miners can show strong positive cash flow generation, investors will likely shy away from funding some miners, posing \"challenges in the equity market for lower margin, higher cost operators with weaker track records for return on capital,\" the analysts said.Bitcoin halving uncertaintyAnother roadblock for mining stocks, this time around, is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April, which will ramp up the competition for the miners. The halving is part of the Bitcoin network's code to reduce inflationary pressure on the cryptocurrency. Miners are rewarded bitcoin for running the network, but every four years, a halving cuts that reward in half.Read CoinDesk's halving coverage here.Bitcoin soared after the last halving in May 2020, and miners joined in. At the time, there weren't many large-scale miners. This time around, though, the market is crowded with many large-scale miners, who will compete for bitcoin rewards that will be cut to 3.125 from 6.25 bitcoin. On top of that, the difficulty of mining a block has also risen to an all-time high, which will make things even tougher post-halving.This poses a significant uncertainty for investors in mining stocks. \"Uncertainty prevails regarding which miners will weather the storm and survive the impending revenue halving,\" George Kikvadze, executive vice chairman of Bitfury Group, wrote in a blog post.\"Consequently, investors seek tangible reassurances amidst this uncertainty and are diverting capital to the perceived safety of Bitcoin ETFs,\" he added.'Temporary setback'So, is there any silver lining for the miners?Galaxy's analysts predict that there are few positive trends that can help the miners. One of them is transaction fees, which could be the \"biggest wildcard\" for mining revenue in 2024. As fees generated by Ordinals – NFT-like assets recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain – have recently helped miners' revenue, and that could help them stay afloat post-halving.\"While we might expect hashrate to drop following the halving [as weaker miners shut down their operations], a significant fee spike around the same period could boost revenues sufficiently high, enabling less efficient miners that would otherwise be unprofitable to still mine at the margin,\" the analysts wrote.Some other options that could also help the miners include hedging their power cost and using the mined bitcoin to hedge pricing volatility. The analysts also predict that mergers and acquisitions will likely ramp up this year as smaller, less efficient miners will likely need to be bought out by larger ones to survive the competition.Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is Poised to Unleash Darwinism on MinersMeanwhile, Bitfury's Kikvadze said that historical precedent suggests miners will \"thrive\" after the halving, despite the market's concern. He looked at the performance of publicly traded miners' stocks during the May 2020 halving, which showed \"miners underperformed or remained on par with Bitcoin in the months leading up to the halving, they outperformed it during the subsequent 'Bitcoin summer' bull run.\"So far, miners have underperformed bitcoin's price heading into the halving event. If history holds true, there might be a chance that mining stocks could catch a bid after the halving event, while a rally in bitcoin price past an all-time high might also help.\"The current lull in publicly traded Bitcoin miners is a temporary setback, anticipated amidst the halving event. As the dust settles, robust miners will shine, and investors will flock to the sector,\" Kikvadze wrote.Read more: Will the Next Bitcoin Halving Be Another Hype Cycle?Edited by Nick Baker."

The Bloomberg, Reuters, CoinDesk and CoinGecko figures are a blend of data from multiple venues.When the Dow Jones Industrial Average hits a record high, there's zero debate over what the new number is or what the old one was.

A positive funding rate indicates that perpetuals are trading at a premium to the spot price and requires traders holding long positions to pay a fee to those holding short positions, a cost they may be inclined to bear.Bitcoin appears to suffered a rejection from the $69,000 region, meaning it is likely to gravitate back to a previous level of support such as $64,000 or even $61,000 before making another attempt to conclusively break the $69,000 mark.In 2020, it took bitcoin more than three weeks to finally crack $20,000. It suffered multiple rejections, dropping to as low as $16,250 amid rising volatility before it eventually broke through. It's likely that bitcoin will enter a range-bound period before taking aim at another break-out attempt.UPDATE (March 5, 16:15 UTC): Adds CoinDesk 20 Index in second paragraph.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "The price of bitcoin (BTC) has set a record high, rising above $69,000 on crypto exchange Coinbase, a level first touched on Nov. 10, 2021.A continuing massive wave of buying by the newish U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs is the likely catalyst behind what's now a historic run higher. The price of bitcoin sat at around $45,000 at the time the ETFs opened for business on Jan. 11. Following a brief \"sell the news\" dip to the $39,000 area, bitcoin quickly rallied above $50,000 by mid-February. After meandering around the $51,000 level for a couple of weeks, prices took off again to the upside towards the end of the month.\"Hard to predict where we stop,\" early bitcoin adopter and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz posted on X on Feb. 28, when the record was in sight. \"Bitcoin is in price discovery phase. Maybe really for the first time since it’s been an asset as now the bulk of U.S. wealth has easy access.\" Novogratz's Galaxy, teaming with asset management giant Invesco, is among the issuers of the 10 U.S.-based spot ETFs now available.Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise – another of the spot ETF issuers – suggested things are just getting started, with $250,000 bitcoin nearing faster than even bulls might fathom.Third bull runMarket observers say that bitcoin, the world's largest digital asset with a market cap of now well over $1 trillion, stepped into a bull market in mid-2023 when BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, began the process of filing to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).This would mark the third bull run for bitcoin, which is driven by the market's acceptance of bitcoin as an institutional-grade asset class via the ETF alongside macroeconomic factors that are going in bitcoin's favor.In a note sent to CoinDesk, Aurelie Barthere, an analyst with Nansen, suggested that the slowdown and end of Fed rate hikes also likely contributed to BTC bottoming in 2022 and the rally after November 2023, with tech stocks also reaching new highs due to AI narratives. The prospect of the Bitcoin Halving, Barthere wrote, is seen as a tailwind for crypto prices, with historical data showing superior returns around the Halving period.\"The strong performance of risk assets overall, like crypto, equities, credit, tell us that financing conditions have probably loosened, especially since November last year and the peak in rates,\" Barthere wrote. \"Investors are also really sanguine about macro prospects (recession no longer consensus), and the risk premium linked to uncertainty about a potential growth shock has come down.\"Analysts also pointed to the end-of-2023 rally as being marked by a lack of liquidity, with David Lawant, FalconX's head of research, writing in October 2023 that a shortage of willing sellers was a factor in driving up prices.Bitcoin's second bull run looked a bit differentDriven by Covid-era monetary policy, the major regulatory changes allowing institutions to embrace bitcoin, the maturing of Ethereum which allowed for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to take off, as well as record venture capital investment in the space, bitcoin rallied throughout most of 2020-2021 before hitting a then-all-time-high of $69,045. But then record-setting inflation and subsequent Fed rate hikes first pushed crypto prices down in the first quarter of 2022. That, however, was just a preview of what would be an annus horribilis for digital assets that began with the collapse of Do Kwon's Luna, was punctuated with the implosion of Celsius and Three Arrows Capital, and finally the demise of Sam Bankman-Fried led FTX.And finally, bitcoin's first rallyWhile 2022 was certainly an exciting year, 2017 might be a runner-up as far as crypto roller coasters go. Bitcoin began the year at just over $900 and ended within inches of $20,000. Along the way, there were regulatory actions by China's central bank, the SEC's rejection of the Winklevoss ETF, and eventually the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) bubble.ICOs, as history would later show, were largely scams with the majority being nothing more than vaporware (however, some of the most important projects we now have in crypto came from this era but they were few and far between).Selling pressure from the end of the ICO era pushed bitcoin down over 70% from its 2018 highs and kicked off the 2018-2019 crypto winter where bitcoin bottomed out at $3,100 before slowly climbing back up to begin the rally that began as Covid stimulus kicked off in March 2020.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

The draw reveals Ethereum's influence and reach – as well as the potential competition.  Ethereum conferences aren't just for Ethereans anymore.Last week's ETHDenver conference in Colorado, one of the year's largest gatherings for developers and users of the Ethereum blockchain, drew in a cross-section of the blockchain industry.The broad swath of attendees might be a testament to Ethereum's influence on other blockchain ecosystems, attracting onlookers from other crypto tribes. But it also might be a sign of rival systems looking to encroach on Ethereum's success in making blockchains more programmable, with its vibrant ecosystem of software developers looking to create new applications.Bitcoin, which is in the midst of a developer renaissance with the advent of its own NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) services, had an impressive turnout of builders at the conference. So did Polkadot, the \"hub-and-spoke\" blockchain created by Gavin Wood, an Ethereum co-founder who used to market his new project as an improvement over the Ethereum model. Even Solana, the speed-focused network that's long positioned itself as an \"ETH Killer,\" had a well-attended booth at Denver's National Western Complex, the conference's venue.John Paller, the conference's founder and executive steward, told CoinDesk in an interview that there were \"probably seven or eight layer 1s that are here, and we have probably 12 layer 2s.\"John Paller, founder and executive steward of ETHDenver. (Sam Kessler)The cross-chain camaraderie might have been out of place in past years, when dueling strains of maximalism defined the blockchain industry. But it makes sense that networks might now wish to make inroads with Ethereum's developer community.\"Even though there are a lot of issues with Ethereum, it is probably the first virtual machine that a developer will interact with if they're new to this ecosystem,\" said David Roebuck, co-founder of TRGC, a crypto investment firm focused on early-stage companies. \"Ethereum, being here for eight or nine years, really has this compounding network effect, so all the layer 1s trying to stay relevant are integrating and doing things with Ethereum.\"The Ethereum community seems more than willing to embrace its competitors, with the rise of \"layer 2\" networks increasing the community's comfort level with working across multiple blockchains.\"As users become more fragmented, and as the developer community on Ethereum starts to become a lot more flexible and versatile across different protocols, you are 100% going to see the 'Ethereum ecosystem' grow to encompass other blockchain ecosystems,\" Christine Kim, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital, told CoinDesk during a conversation in the ETHDenver press office.ETHDenver 2024's Big TentEthereum's biggest weakness has always been its transaction fees, which can make something as simple as a token swap cost upwards of $10 in fees alone. \"Ethereum is not planning on bringing down fees for its users, and that's a reality that people need to understand,\" explained Kim.To circumvent its fee problems, Ethereum has gone full-throttle on rollups, the \"layer 2\" networks that settle transactions on the Ethereum chain but offer lower fees and higher speeds to users.\"Ethereum is king,\" said Paller. \"It's how do we build around Ethereum, with layer 2s to ZK-fill-in-the-blanks or whatever.\"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin started to advocate for a \"rollup-centric\" roadmap for the chain in 2020, and over the past year his vision has been realized, with layer-2 rollup networks like Arbitrum, Optimism and the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase's Base consistently surpassing Ethereum in overall traffic.While Ethereum's rollups ultimately pass data to the base Ethereum chain, they're still separate networks – each with its own programming, app ecosystem and community.\"All of this talk around interoperability between rollups naturally leads to conversations of, well, why aren't we having increased interoperability with other execution environments like the Solana VM,\" or the Cosmos ecosystem, said Kim.The \"data availability\" problemAs the Ethereum umbrella expands to include other blockchains, it must lean into one of its weakest use cases: data availability, or \"DA.\"When blockchains need to store data, they frequently lean on other blockchains: So-called data availability layers, which keep a full record of a chain's transaction data so it can be formally verified.While Ethereum can technically be used as a data availability layer, there are other networks, like Celestia and Filecoin, for which data availability is their bread and butter.\"In terms of its reliability and resilience, I think Ethereum as a data availability layer is unmatched,\" Kim said. \"However, you have the problem of high fees and high costs. You have other cheaper data availability solutions.\"Ethereum's next big upgrade, Dencun, will happen later this month, and is explicitly designed to make the network friendlier for layer-2 services via improved data availability: The key upgrade, \"danksharding,\" re-jiggers the network's programming to make it easier for layer 2s to settle \"blobs\" of data onto the chain – theoretically, as a way to ramp up Ethereum's capacity to store L2 transaction information.But Dencun might be too little too late. Ethereum is ultimately playing catch-up in the realm of data availability, and it's unlikely that its costs will decrease to get within range of other DA networks anytime soon.The risk for EthereumAs Ethereum continues to shift in the direction of layer 2s and cross-chain interoperability, it risks \"ceding its dominance as a general purpose platform for general-purpose compute,\" Kim said.Ethereum is currently the largest blockchain for \"general computation\" – both in terms of the size of its developer community, as well as the level of liquidity in its decentralized finance ecosystem.Its expansion to new ecosystems comes amid a wider trend of blockchain \"modularity,\" where apps that would have historically lived on one blockchain are now picking and choosing pieces of different blockchain architectures, and deploying elements of their programs across all of them.\"Applications are cross-chain, their architectures are cross-chain,\" said Sam Friedman, a principal solutions architect at Chainlink Labs, which builds interoperability architecture for blockchains. \"It's not independent instances of the app on different chains. It's the same app with different components\" on different chains.With the shift towards modularity, Ethereum's lead in the blockchain race might begin to blur, if not erode altogether, given its speed, cost and data storage shortcomings.Meanwhile, builders from the other blockchain ecosystems are waiting in the wings.\"If there was some Ethereum killer that showed up and had better tech, and the ability to build a stronger, more vibrant, more durable community than Ethereum, then it should win,\" said Paller.Margaux Nijkerk contributed reporting."

The broader CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) was higher by 4.7%. According to Laurent Kssis, a crypto ETP specialist at CEC Capital, another rally could be on the way. Buying pressure looks strong from retail investors, who consider the recent spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows to be a key momentum phase. “Inflows are still very supportive and not quite yet over, which may and could continue to push the price upwards in the crypto currency markets,\" he said.Deutsche Boerse, the operator of Germany’s largest stock exchange, has started a crypto spot trading platform for institutional clients, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. DBDX offers a fully regulated ecosystem for trading, settlement and custody of crypto assets, the firm said. Initially, trading on DBDX will operate on a request-for-quote (RFQ) basis, followed by multilateral trading. Deutsche Boerse will operate the trading venue, and Crypto Finance will provide settlement and custody services.Baanx, a cryptocurrency payments specialist authorized by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has raised $20 million in Series A funding round, the company said on Tuesday.

        "content": "The \"wealth effect\" from unrealized crypto-market gains could inject demand-pull inflation into the economy.That could force the Fed to reassess its December projection of implementing three interest-rate cuts in 2024.Bitcoin's (BTC) bull run could add to inflation in the U.S. economy, making it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.The leading cryptocurrency by market value has gained over 50% in 2024 already, extending last year's 155% surge to trade within striking distance of record highs near $69,000. Ether (ETH) has also surged, and the CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, has jumped 57% this year. The total crypto market capitalization has added 53% to $2.64 trillion.The crypto market, which began as a niche segment for technology-savvy investors, has evolved into a mature asset class over the past three years, thanks to a decision by software developer MicroStrategy and other corporations to add bitcoin to their balance sheets as well as the successful launch of U.S.-listed futures and spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds.A 2023 paper by Harvard Business School's Marco Di Maggio and his team of economists estimated that the marginal propensity to consume – the amount spent on consumption for each additional dollar earned – out of unrealized crypto market gains is double that of stocks. That means a sharp rally in crypto prices, like the current one, can lead to a wealth effect that injects inflation into the economy by creating extra demand.\"The rise in bitcoin and ETH and alts is inflationary as it creates more money-like assets and a strong wealth effect for young people with a high marginal propensity to spend,\" Brent Donelly, president of Spectra Markets, said on X.The wealth effect is a behavioral economics concept that says that individuals, households and businesses spend more when the value of their financial assets rises. That increased spending is financed, essentially, by wealth created out of thin air – asset price gains. However, it adds to demand-side forces in the economy, putting upward pressure on prices.The Fed and other central banks exploited the wealth effect to help handle the financial crash of 2008 and Covid hit of 2020, using unlimited bond purchases and zero-interest-rate policies to target the \"asset prices and the wealth effect channel,\" the study said. That helped shore up consumption and lift domestic inflation rates toward the 2% target.According to the Harvard study, crypto investors are everyday investors seeking to diversify their portfolios, leading to a wealth effect that is more pronounced in the housing sector.\"Crypto wealth causes house price appreciation—counties with higher crypto wealth see higher growth in home values following high crypto returns,\" the study said.Over the years, the stock market has become more concentrated in the hands of the wealthy, which limits the wealth effect of an equities rally to luxury goods. In contrast, the market for alternative cryptocurrencies is dominated by retail investors. As such, sharp rallies in altcoins could affect the general price level in the economy.That said, the crypto market isn't the only asset class on the move. The U.S. stock market has also jumped with both the broad-based S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite indexes hitting record highs in recent days.\"Both are creating a simultaneous inflationary wealth effect for two wildly different demographics that believe in two wildly different narratives,\" Spectra Markets' Donelly said on X, explaining the inflationary impact of the crypto-market rally.Bitcoin (line plot) has tracked the Nasdaq (NDX)-to-S&P 500 (SPX) ratio (candle plot) higher. (TradingView) (TradingView)Fed to reassess rate cut projection?In December, the Fed said it would make three quarter-point interest-rate cuts by the end of 2024, bringing the benchmark borrowing cost down to 4.6%.However, spillover effects from the crypto and stock market rallies might force the central bank to walk back on its estimates and hold rates higher for longer.The central bank raised rates by 525 basis points between March 2022 and July 2023 to tame growth in the consumer price index, which had risen as high as 9.1% in mid-2022. As of January, the inflation rate on an annual basis stood at 3.1%.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Miners need to be proactive and cannot afford to just maintain their position in the network, the report said.“They must constantly push to acquire more hashrate as well as increase the efficiency of their hashrate, acquire lower-cost energy from cheaper sources, and expand their infrastructure to house any new machines,” Gray wrote. At the same time, every other miner is also bidding for the same resources.Fidelity notes that the months after halving are the most difficult, because while bitcoin “plays catch-up to the immediate pay cut,” miners need capital reserves to offset the drop in revenue.Still, as the protocol evolves, new layers could emerge bringing new use cases and more users, the note said.“While the past halvings did see a flush-out of weaker miners, the industry ultimately recovered with more miners and hashrate than ever, demonstrating the resiliency of the network and industry,” the report added.Read more: Bitcoin Could Slide to $42K After Halving Hype Subsides, JPMorgan SaysEdited by Sheldon Reback."

It was recently up 8.5% over the past 24 hours, roughly in line with the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index's (CD20) 8% advance.With this year's meteoric rise, BTC is rapidly becoming one of the largest global assets, and at current levels has surpassed the $1.3 trillion market capitalization threshold. It is now closing in on silver's market cap of $1.4 trillion, according to data compiled by CompaniesMarketCap after earlier in this bull run toppling that of Facebook parent company Meta Platforms (META).Monday's price action also squeezed bitcoin shorts – trading positions betting on lower prices – liquidating some $120 million of leveraged bets during the day, predominantly shorts, CoinGlass data shows.Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto by market cap, rose above $3,600 on Monday for the first time since 2022, but underperformed BTC and the CD20 with just a 4.6% gain.Meme coins are on a tear, with dog-themed cryptocurrencies dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) being the best-performing tokens in the CD20, advancing 30% and 100% over the past 24 hours, respectively.Bitcoin ETF frenzy continuesThe price rally also brought another day of strong trading for U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs.BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) surpassed $2.1 billion in trading volume with still some time before the session close, already recording its third-best day after last Wednesday and Thursday, Barchart data shows. IBIT was the seventh most-traded ETF during the day, toppling the first and largest U.S.-listed gold ETF – the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) – in volume despite being fifth of its size by assets under management (AUM).Last week, bitcoin-focused exchange-traded products as a group attracted \"massive inflows\" of $1.73 billion, their second largest week on record, asset manager CoinShares reported Monday. ETH focused funds were also in demand, recording $85 million in net inflows, the report added.Bitcoin all-time high this week?Markus Thielen, founder of 10xResearch, forecasted in a Monday market report that bitcoin's price action will \"astonish\" this week, suspecting new all-time highs this week as demand expanded to outside of the U.S. and ETF inflows will continue to be strong.Bitcoin is also outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX), Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics, noted in a Sunday report. He called bitcoin's breakout versus NDX above a key level connecting the first quarter 2021 and last quarter 2021 highs \"extremely encouraging.\"\"Bitcoin is about to enter price discovery (again) and people are somehow bearish? Couldn't be me,\" he said in an X post Monday.Crypto analytics firm Swissblock's Monday market update highlighted bitcoin's strong momentum and the influx of new buyers entering the market. The report said that the current crypto rally is driven by large investors' demand for BTC and ETH amid weakling U.S. regional banks, and rising appetite for meme coins buoyed by FOMO – fear of missing out – sentiment.Swissblock also set that a $70,000 bitcoin price is a \"plausible target\" in the short-term, toppling its all-time record price from Nov. 2021.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

The first and largest cryptocurrency by market cap is up over 6% just in the past 24 hours, after crossing a supposedly psychologically important threshold of $65,000 according to CoinDesk Indices data. It’s now within striking distance of its all-time high around $69,000, last seen at the end of 2021 — before the bad things happened.Many people, even industry insiders, have been taken aback by the price action, given how bleak market sentiment around crypto was even just a few months ago. Not even a major exchange like Coinbase saw it coming, given that a boost in trading activity caused (another) outage. It’s enough of a surprise that some people feel hesitant to say this is the beginning of another bull run, given that things could fall back as quickly as bitcoin ran up.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteBut there are legitimate differences that already set this cycle apart from the 2020-21 hype cycle — with the bear market washing out some of the worst aspects of the industry. Is it necessarily the case that rising interest in crypto be coupled with fraud, crime and cringe-worthy behavior? Though it’s dangerous to say it, this time could be different.First, there’s the multi-billion dollar question: Will spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds continue to grow and grow. The 10 live funds have seen $8 billion in net inflows so far, which has not only helped re-legitimize crypto given the involvement of trustworthy financial institutions including BlackRock, Fidelity and Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch, but also placed significant buying pressure on the underlying commodity, bitcoin.It’s possible ETFs have changed market dynamics by giving a safer way for people to gain exposure. If anything, these ETFs prove that there was latent demand for bitcoin from all corners of the market, from retail investors to ultra high-net worth individuals asking their banks for crypto exposure. BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, for instance, is the first fund to reach $10 billion in assets under management this quickly — and some say the next $10 billion could flow in even faster.See also: Welcome to the 'Bitcoin Era' on Wall Street | OpinionBut TradFi’s attention isn’t fixated solely on ETFs. CME Group’s crypto derivatives products, typically viewed as a proxy for institutional interest, are experiencing record volumes. A similar trend happened last cycle, where interest in crypto begets more and more interest from more and more sectors. The more crypto goes up, the more people want to play with it.Celebrities aren't hereInterestingly, the current cycle hasn’t attracted the same level of involvement from celebrities — at least yet. This could be a factor of not having a figure like Sam Bankman-Fried who wanted to buy public trust in FTX by bankrolling celebrity endorsements. It’s possible the SEC suing Kim Kardashian or the cast of characters who allegedly advertised TRON without disclosing it will keep Hollywood at bay.Of course all this could change — Paris Hilton could trot out her Bored Ape again any day — but for now the lack of “influencers” is a positive development considering that research shows how poorly their investment “advice” tends to be. Likewise, the voices that dominated the last cycle — figures like Alex Machinsky, BitBoy, Changpeng Zhao, Do Kwon, SBF, Su Zhu, etc. — largely have been discredited, and it seems like this is a power vacuum crypto is hoping stays empty.See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto? | OpinionThat in itself could be wishful thinking, and it’s worth considering why influencers emerge in the first place. One theory is that crypto has influencers because crypto prices are self-reflexive (aka “number go up technology”), and someone tends to emerge to coordinate attention towards one project or another. This is amplified, as Bloomberg notes, by the ability for traders to load up on borrowed funds, gaining leverage to try to max out trading profits.Given the amount of credit already building up in crypto markets (open interest in bitcoin futures is up 90% since last fall on platforms like Binance, OKX and BitMEX, which can be leveraged up to 100x) and the tremendous amount of capital flowing into meme coins like DOGE and SHIB, it’s clear enough people are looking to gamble big this time around, too.See also: Bitcoin Futures Open Interest Tops $21B, Highest Since November 2021 Institutional lendingWhile the laws in the U.S. haven’t yet changed, over the past few years notable advancements including the E.U.’s MiCA, UAE’s digital asset trading licensing program and lobbying efforts in places like Canada mean more traders could soon have more regulated means of gaining access to crypto derivatives.There’s a hope that the crypto lending sector won’t take as nasty a turn as last time, given that it ended up being dominated by a handful of now bankrupt “hedge funds” like Alameda Research and Three Arrows Capital, which were supposed to be generating the yield paid to customers of now bankrupt lending platforms like Celsius, BlockFi and Genesis.For instance, tokenization giant Securitize, recently spun up an “Earn” program that offers yields via over-collateralized loans and tokenized funds for financial titans KKR and Hamilton Lane. For now, while still assessing demand for the product, Securitize itself will be paying for it is billing as “sustainable” yield to users off its balance sheet, Reid Simon, Securitize's head of credit, told CoinDesk in an interview.This in itself is an interesting move, signaling how important lending programs are as one of the few ways to put digital assets towards productive use. “It’s a business we want to get into,” Simon said, noting that it’s “unclear” how well the crypto-native firm's brand has resonated with crypto. “I don't necessarily think of Securitize and bitcoin together,” he said.See also: Crypto for Advisors: Private Credit Meets the BlockchainOther crypto lending operators have spoken at length about the ways things went off the rails last time, and others have noted there are ways for the industry to self-regulate, like by separating crypto trading from custody and advocating for proof-of-reserves.There’s no guarantee the same mistakes won’t be made again (or that bitcoin will continue to climb if it regains its all-time high at all). It’s worth noting the recent rally has come alongside significant advancements on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes and renewed growth in the U.S. tech sector, surprising many on-lookers who thought raised interest rates would keep capital out of risk-heavy sectors.It’s possible that crypto is doomed to Sisyphean cycles of rising rates of illicit use, fraud, speculation, cringe-inducing endorsements and greed every time prices boom, simply by nature of how these hype cycles unfold. But, for now, with the worst aspects of the industry washed out, and many wanting to do things differently (read: legitimately), it’s worth hoping things won’t take a turn for the worse.Must everything that goes up turn down? Is this time really different?"

The plaintiff, the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), hopes the trial's outcome – should it confirm Wright is not Satoshi – would end his legal battles with the broader crypto community working on Bitcoin.After Wright made a reference last week to some emails between him and his former legal representatives at Ontier, his current lawyers were compelled to submit those emails to evidence. An inconsistency forced them to check with Ontier on the accuracy of the correspondence submitted by Wright’s wife Ramona Watts. Ontier then responded the emails appeared to be “not genuine.”COPA is set to put the new allegations of forgery to Wright on Friday.Counsel for both COPA and Wright this week tried to undermine expert witnesses for the other party, particularly questioning their “independence.” Wright’s team on Monday questioned COPA expert witness Patrick Madden on why he’d enlisted the help of COPA’s counsel at Bird & Bird LLP to organize the findings of his investigation into Wright’s claims instead of seeking independent help. On Wednesday, the COPA camp, in turn, asked Wright’s expert witness ZeMing Gao, who has authored multiple essays asserting Wright is Satoshi, whether he was truly an objective expert.In addition to Gao, cryptography and security expert Sarah Meiklejohn took the stand for COPA on Wednesday to defend – among other things – her findings indicating key cryptographic signings Wright did as proof he's Satoshi may have been inadequate.After Friday, the court will resume on March 12 for closing statements from both sides.Edited by Nikhilesh De."

        "content": "When Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox collapsed in February 2014, there were well-founded fears that it could kill the nascent cryptocurrency before it was more than five years out of the cradle. It is easy now to scoff at such suggestions, but many people thought along these lines given that Bitcoin had not yet faced such a catastrophe.Mark Hunter has been an author and ghostwriter for 20 years and a leading cryptocurrency writer since 2017. He is the author of “Ultimate Catastrophe: How Mt. Gox Lost Half a Billion Dollars and Nearly Killed Bitcoin” co-creator and co-host of the podcast series “Dr Bitcoin: The Man Who Wasn't Satoshi Nakamoto.”UnmuteOver 880,000 BTC were lost by or stolen from Mt. Gox in various guises between March 2011 and January 2014, a haul worth a staggering $45 billion today, and yet with the 10th anniversary of its collapse upon us, there are still several important questions that remain unanswered.Who did it?One of the key questions that remains unknown is whether we know all of the culprits. Over 809,000 BTC were stolen across six hacks during Mt. Gox’s lifetime, and we only know of two names linked to one hack: Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner, who are accused of being part of the Russian hacking group that compromised the exchange in October 2011. Over the course of 26 months, the pair helped steal and launder 647,000 bitcoins from the exchange’s cold wallets.Verner and Bilyuchenko have only been charged by U.S. authorities with the laundering of the coins rather than the hack itself, however, which could suggest a lack of evidence against them on that charge.See also: Where the Mt. Gox Money WentApart from these allegations, sealed in 2017 and made public in June last year, we have no idea who stole the remaining 162,000 BTC. 79,956 BTC remain tied to a well-known address beginning ‘1Feex’, while 77,500 stolen in September 2011 have never been traced. This hack was so successful it was not detected until 2015.Then there’s the individual who stole 2,000 BTC in June 2011, which sent the value of bitcoin crashing from $17.50 to $0.01, and the hacker who swiped more than half the coins held by the exchange at the time, when Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpelès left the wallet on a drive with unencrypted network. Fortunately for Karpelès the hacker got cold feet and negotiated a 1% bounty, leading to a loss of just 3,000 BTC for the exchange, rather than 300,000 BTC.In all these cases we have no idea who did the deed, and it’s almost certain now that we never will. Many suspect the 1Feex hack was a dry run for the debilitating October 2011-January 2014 exploit, given that the modus operandi was the same, but this has never been confirmed.How did it happen?Of the 881,865 BTC which left Mt. Gox unintentionally, we can only say for sure how 72,409 BTC were lost. 30,000 BTC were logged as deposits to customers by Mt. Gox’s system when they were in fact being stolen by hackers. An error by Mark Karpelès in October 2011 led to 2,609 being sent to a non-existent address. Two bots operating on Mt. Gox, Markus and Willy, lost 22,800 BTC. And Karpelès bought Polish exchange Bitomat for 17,000 BTC in July 2011.When it comes to the remainder, the method of entry is generally either unknown or merely suspected. In the case of the June 2011 hack, we know that the hacker was able to get access to the Mt. Gox server through an administrator-level account. This was initially attributed to auditor Auden McKernan but it was later revealed that it was the account of Jed McCaleb, the founder who had sold Mt. Gox to Mark Karpelès, which inexplicably still had administrator privileges. It is thought that the hacker obtained the details when the entire Mt. Gox user database was stolen along with the 79,956 BTC in the 1Feex hack.See also: Why Bitcoin's Greatest Hack Still Matters: The Legacy of Mt. Gox Given that U.S. authorities were confident in naming Verner and Bilyuchenko as being part of a group that hacked into Mt. Gox in October 2011 they must have some evidence to back up their assertions, but unless it ever comes to a trial (which is almost certainly won’t now that their names are public) these details will likely never be divulged.How safe were the Mt. Gox bitcoins?Related to the question of how the hackers gained access to the Mt. Gox servers is the question of how they were then able to access the funds supposedly securely stored in cold wallets. We know that until the June 2011 hack, Karpelès kept users’ bitcoins in a haphazard manner across various physical and software wallets, which exacerbated the impact of the hacks and prolonged the cleanup.Karpelès claims that this incident led him to incorporate a much more secure system: he split the coins across numerous paper wallets (he later said hundreds of pieces of paper were involved) and stashed them in bank vaults and safety deposit boxes around Tokyo. Therefore, if the hot wallet was stolen again, as it was for the 1Feex hack, the cold wallets should not be affected.This seems safe enough in itself, but when it was revealed that the exchange’s cold wallets had indeed been ransacked between October 2011 and January 2014, many started to ask questions, including then Bitcoin blogger and future General Partner at crypto investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, Arianna Simpson:“If you’re doing it right, the cold storage should not be accessible via the hot wallet, leak or no leak. That’s the whole point of separating the two.”So how were the cold wallets compromised? Karpelès has never confirmed his bespoke cold wallet-hot wallet setup, potentially to avoid lawsuits based on the mishandling of funds, but he has given hints in interviews that paint an inconsistent and at times illogical scenario.The only way to safely top up a hot wallet with funds from a paper wallet is to go and get the paper wallet and execute a multi-step manual transaction on an ultra-secure network. This must be done every single time, which is of course entirely impractical for any Bitcoin exchange no matter what its size or trading volume. No Mt. Gox staff member has reported seeing Mark Karpelès handling paper wallets, and indeed some prominent members of staff told me for “Ultimate Catastrophe: How Mt. Gox Lost Half a Billion Dollars and Nearly Killed Bitcoin” that they had only ever heard hot wallets mentioned, never cold wallets.See also: Mt. Gox Bitcoin (BTC) Payments Move CloserWas there, therefore, a system that automatically topped up the hot wallet from the cold wallets when it ran dry and vice versa? This seems to be the only feasible way in which the exchange could have operated, although it totally undermines the principles of a cold wallet system.Did Mark Karpelès know the exchange was broke?This is the big question that still divides opinion. Naturally, Karpelès insists that he didn’t know the exchange had been bled dry until he checked the cold wallets in mid-February 2014, but there are flaws with this claim. Mt. Gox had started experiencing bitcoin withdrawal issues as far back as August 2013, which should have raised red flags. And yet Karpelès seems not to have considered Mt. Gox was underfunded, despite the exchange having been the victim of multiple hacks in its lifetime.Karpelès was quick to blame the “transaction malleability” bug when it emerged in early 2014 as the reason for withdrawal issues, but this was known to require a tremendous amount of social engineering to pull off even a small theft. He also said he didn’t suspect any losses because there was a monitoring system in place. If such a system existed then it wasn’t designed properly, which is indicative of the kind of mismanagement that plagued the exchange.Needless to say, there are plenty who refuse to believe that Karpelès only discovered the loss in February 2014. Others go further in saying Karpelès not only knew about the missing bitcoins, but used Willy and Markus to make up the loss. If this was Karpelès’ intention it backfired spectacularly: the pair lost 22,800 BTC and $51.6 million between them before the exchange collapsed.The simple answer is that we can only speculate as to how the bitcoins on Mt. Gox were secured, and unless Mark Karpelès deigns to tell us it will remain that way."

Ether (ETH) topped $3,300, and the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader market, jumped 3.5% to $2,177. The bears, if any, have been put on notice as bitcoin (BTC) is now just 16% short of challenging the record high of $69,000. The distance could be covered easily before April’s mining reward halving, assuming Wall Street continues pouring money into the spot exchange-traded funds, maintaining the demand-supply imbalance. That said, the market increasingly looks overheated, not only in terms of funding rates, but also because, as Santiment data show, the top trending cryptocurrency on social media in the past 24 hours is PEPE. The meme token’s market cap has skyrocketed by 153% this week, CoinDesk data show. Such frenzied action in smaller coins often presages market-wide price pullbacks. While past performance is no guarantee of future behavior, some traders have started purchasing bitcoin puts to hedge potential downside risks.BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Tuesday set a record high of $1.36 billion in trading volume, surpassing Monday's $1.3 billion tally, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The ETF, which trades under the ticker IBIT on Nasdaq, saw nearly 42 million shares change hands, more than double its lifetime average. While high volume is often perceived as bullish, it's not necessarily the case, according to NYDIG's global head of research, Greg Cipolaro, who prefers to track the ratio between the dollar trading volume and the fund's net asset value. \"This ratio shows the proportion of the fund's assets traded on any given day, offering a glimpse into the investor and trader profiles and potentially what motivates their investment choices,\" Cipolaro wrote.While Wall Street has embraced digital assets, \"the powers that be\" maintain their tough stance. In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) called out the crypto industry for being reluctant to follow the rules that guide the U.S. financial system. \"I wanna collaborate with the industry, what I don't understand is why the industry seems to be saying that the only way that they can survive is if there's plenty of space for the drug traffickers and the human traffickers, oh and the terrorist, and the ransomware scammer, and the consumer scammers …,\" Warren said.Chart of the DayWeekly transactions on Scroll.

Like it's the pristine asset.\"\"Stacks Nakamoto launch is only a few months out at this point, then I think the developers can program anything that they want.\"\"There are new experiments coming.\"There's a buzz around Bitcoin these days, and it's got as much to do with the development taking place on the original blockchain – once seen as a sleepy and ultra-conservative ecosystem compared with Ethereum, and its higher frequency of upgrades and greater programmability – as with the newly approved spot bitcoin ETFs that have pulled in billions of dollars from investors.Bitcoin the cryptocurrency is in the midst of a powerful rally, headed for a sixth straight monthly gain, its longest such streak in three years. With a market capitalization of $1.12 trillion, bitcoin (BTC) accounts for roughly half the value of all cryptocurrencies; put another way, it's worth as much as all other digital assets combined.But it's the newfound spirit of development that's got engineers and programmers including Muneeb Ali, CEO of Trust Machines and co-creator of the Stacks project, suddenly hitting the talking circuit. Top blockchain tech podcasts are airing episodes about the prospects for Bitcoin layer-2 networks, analysts are scurrying to assess the potential, NFT-like digital art on Bitcoin are fetching tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and there's even a new venture-capital fund to plunk down money into Bitcoin DeFi projects.CoinDesk's Jenn Sanasie interviewed Ali, who has a Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University, about the flurry of activity, and what he sees as the real breakthroughs that are making it all possible, and what he expects to come of it all. He also spoke about the Stacks project's much-anticipated Nakamoto upgrade, tipped to drastically improve the speed.The interview was transcribed by Bradley Keoun and lightly edited for clarity.What are you watching in the news these days?Ali: One of the news items recently that caught my eye was a recent funding round of EigenLayer. So they raised around $100 million from A16Z. I think the thing that interests me about that particular protocol is that it's looking at capital that's locked on ETH and trying to find interesting use cases for it. How can you reuse the locked capital? And I'm very interested in seeing these types of primitives evolve around Bitcoin as well.We know that Bitcoin is sort of like the apex predator. Like it's the pristine asset. And these types of concepts coming to Bitcoin could be much more significant because Bitcoin is a trillion dollars in capital. And we are just seeing the start of people locking their BTC capital into smart contracts running on L2s and so on. And I think if we can provide people with increased flexibility, where they could lock BTC in a contract, but then potentially reuse it in other interesting ways, obviously it comes with risks and all.EigenLayer is a really hot topic lately, really exciting project that everyone is talking about. How difficult would it be to bring something like this to Bitcoin, and what kind of timeline would we be looking at to see this kind of development in the Bitcoin ecosystem?Ali: I think the main difficulty in bringing these types of protocols to Bitcoin has always been at the L2 infrastructure layer. So there are two parts to it. One is, what's the consensus mechanism for the L2? Is it really secured by Bitcoin? That's work that, for example, Stacks has done with the Stacks Nakamoto launch, where your transactions are secured by 100% of Bitcoin hashpower. And the second thing is how secure it is to move your BTC from L1 into L2.And over there, Stacks has done some work with sBTC, but other projects like BitVM actually reduced the trust assumptions significantly. So I think we're making progress on both those two sort of like critical infrastructure points. Once that's done, and I think we are very close, Stacks Nakamoto launch is only a few months out at this point, then I think the developers can program anything that they want within the L2 environment. So that's sort of like the exciting part, that once these infrastructure challenges are behind us, I think we can unlock a lot of creativity by developers using BTC as the asset.For so long, Bitcoin was an ecosystem that was relatively unchanged, right? Sitting here in 2024, talking about these developments, how does it feel to be sitting here and talking about Bitcoin evolving at such a rapid pace?Ali: I think that's definitely interesting. I would say that from where I stand, it definitely took longer than I expected. For example, I mean, we knew that ecosystems outside of Bitcoin can move faster, they can take more risks, and they can innovate faster as well. But you can sort of watch some of those experiments and the stuff that's working out. For example, one clear example would be stablecoins. At this point, we know stablecoins work. They have clear product market fit, people want them, people want to use them, then these primitives would come to Bitcoin. I think the coming-to-Bitcoin part was slower than we anticipated, but it definitely feels good that it's finally happening. And I think Ordinals and Casey [Rodarmor], they deserve a lot of credit. Like, I do think when Ordinals started, that was sort of like the spark whereBitcoin culture started changing, the amount of developers and capital coming into Bitcoin started changing. And then some of the OG projects like Stacks and others who are already working, I think they got some sort of a fresh fuel on the fire as well. And people saw that, look, a lot of this stuff is already built or almost there, and now developers are getting really excited about it. So I think in some ways, I'm glad that we took the slow and steady approach, that we're still around to see the innovation coming back to Bitcoin, and I think that's an exciting time to be here.Let's talk a little bit more about Stacks. You mentioned the Nakamoto upgrade that's coming up soon. Talk to me about your focus for Stacks as we move further into 2024 and what we can expect from the upgrade.Ali: As Bitcoiners, we definitely have a different set of values. There is definitely much more long-term thinking. There's definitely aversion to taking needless risks. So I think the Stacks L2 project basically represents a lot of that. For example, a lot of R&D work went into designing really safe programming languages. Similarly, on the consensus side, a ton of work went into reusing Bitcoin's hash power as much as possible, or reusing Bitcoin security as much as possible. I think it definitely shows that long-term thinking. So the Nakamoto launch has been in the works, I would say at this point, almost like two years. And a lot of challenges, frankly, were operating as a decentralized ecosystem. Again, going back to the ethos of Bitcoin, the Stacks L2 ecosystem itself is heavily decentralized. I think there are like 10-plus different entities that are contributing to some of the core software and there are like 20 or more outside of that as well. And sometimes there is a lot of overhead and challenges in functioning as a decentralized ecosystem, but I think it's better for the long-term health as well. So with the Stacks Nakamoto, things are finally coming together and maybe the timing would work out as well. A lot of devs are excited about doing the launch of Nakamoto, which is basically a much faster L2 that is secured by 100% of Bitcoin hashpower.And so people are looking forward to that increase in speed and functionality. But the timing might be very interesting because right now it's scheduled for approximately when Bitcoin halving is happening. And I think that would be sort of interesting because Bitcoin, there's a lot of attention on Bitcoin during the halving time. And if the major L2 is doing a launch around the same time, I think that'd be very exciting.I'll be on the edge of my seat waiting for that. Let's talk a little bit about Bitcoin scalability. Layer 2s are really meant to solve some of the scalability challenges with the network. Talk to me about if that's happening, what still needs to happen.Ali: Let's say that at a rough approximation, you know, 100 million people use Bitcoin. I think the numbers are off, depending on, like, what data set you use, but let's say approximately it's 100 million people right now. To get to a billion people, we know for sure that it's not going to happen on the Bitcoin L1. Like there's basically no way, right? Like if they wouldn't be able to own a UTXO on-chain. So we absolutely need these L2 solutions.And one of the things that has changed in the last one year is that, before, the Bitcoin community was sort of putting all of the scalability eggs in the same basket, which was Lightning. And don't get me wrong, Lightning is amazing. I think some of the companies there have done groundbreaking work. They're growing, they're actually getting more nodes online. But interestingly, over the last one year, this sort of attitude has shifted to, Let's try all sorts of experiments as L2s. And this is something that happened with Ethereum. We see almost like 10 to 20 big projects. But in terms of experiments that people tried, it would probably be 100 or 200 or more. And some of them didn't work out. Some of them became bigger projects with more traction, more capital, more developers, and so on. And now we are beginning to see that with Bitcoin. There's obviously Stacks and Rootstock, which are the more OGs. But there are a fresh batch of new L2s coming up. That is very, very exciting.Because what happens is you let the free markets try different designs, and then people are tweaking things. They're trying different iterations and remixes of different ideas. And the probability that at least a few of them are going to work is actually much, much higher than putting all of your eggs in the same basket. So I think with that happening, my confidence level that we will have some L2s that are actually sort of working out commercially in the market and taking a lot of load off of Bitcoin L1, where the experience is great, people can do fast, cheap transactions and infrastructure sort of goes in the background. That's like where we want to be, where Bitcoin infrastructure is just in the background, it's reliable, people just can do fast, cheap payments and it sort of works all the time. And I think with these new experiments, I think some of the L2s would definitely be able to deliver on that.Ordinals have really revived the NFT narrative. And it's interesting that that came from the Bitcoin ecosystem. Do you think that we're going to see some of that traction that we saw with Ethereum come over to Bitcoin?Ali: I'll separate out the two things here. One about Ordinals. I'm of the view that usually when something finds product market fit, there is like one core property that sort of stands out and people just get it, right? Often it's like something very simple. For the case of Bitcoin as money, it's 21 million coins. It's as simple as that. People know that there only ever will be 21 million coins, and it's durable, it's not gonna change, and people get it. It's a very simple thing. And if you look at Ethereum, they've tried very complicated arguments around ultrasound money and how, you know, supply is changing and this and that, and that complicated thing is actually not working. The simple, there will only be 21 million coins is actually what's working in the market.Same with NFTs when I look at it. Yes, there are many other factors, but just the fact that with Ordinals, the image is literally on the chain. And it's not on any chain, it's on Bitcoin, right? We know that Bitcoin is going to be around. I think that one property just stands out. Like people just feel that, you know, this is real, this thing is never gonna disappear, and my digital art is now stored forever. And that's it. Like I think that's the base level property. And then there are obviously other things around it that are leading to a lot of sort of interest there. And I think with Bitcoin DeFi, which is the main thing that gets enabled by L2s, we'll again see these simple primitives. For example, one I can think of is a lot of people don't want to sell their Bitcoin. So a very simple primitive could be, Hey, don't sell your Bitcoin, but lock it in a decentralized way and get some liquidity. Take a stablecoin loan. Again, a simple concept that a lot of people get, and they can start using it. I think that's how you start getting a lot of product market fit.And now coming to your second question, I do think that in the overall industry right now, there's a lot of capital and developers who have the model that there will be some alt L1 like a Solana or something else, they're going to start eating on Ethereum's market share. I think there's some truth to it. Solana is gaining a lot of traction and it's popular in developers and so on. But I think what the market is beginning to see right now is that there's a much bigger category, which is Bitcoin L2s, because these Bitcoin L2s can match the alt L1s or Ethereum head-to-head on every single feature. It could be speed, it could be expressivity, and so on, but they can match it. And I think that could potentially be a much bigger market simply because of the fact that they're not starting from zero. Like whenever you launch a new project, you're sort starting from zero in terms of how much capital there is in that ecosystem. When you launch a Bitcoin L2, you're launching something on top of a trillion dollars of capital, right? So I think there's a much easier path to that capital getting deployed and Bitcoin L2s as a category growing. So I do think they're going to start giving Eth L2s some competition, but even like Eth L1 might start seeing competition coming from Bitcoin L2s, which is something that I don't think a lot of people are talking about.Besides Stacks, what Bitcoin L2 are you watching? What Bitcoin L2 is doing something very innovative that you're keeping your eye on?Ali: The landscape right now, what it looks like is, uh, there are the big four, which is Stacks, Rootstock, Lightning and Liquid. And they're all sort of, very different, right? Liquid is a federation. Lightning is mostly for payments and a peer-to-peer thing. I think Rootstock and Stacks would qualify as, what the Ethereum or Solana developers expect from an L2. Right? So those are the two bigger ones.And then there are new experiments coming. I think Babylon is one. They're doing something very interesting with enabling Bitcoin to be locked at the L1 level and you're sort of like participating in proof-of-stake on other chains. I think that's a very interesting model. Some people have worked on things called Spiderchains, which are, again, interesting. The common trend there is trying to reuse BTC capital. They can't take Bitcoin capital and participate in becoming a validator on an L2 or some other ecosystem out there.And I'll come back to the project that I'm very, very excited about, which is BitVM. It's not something that is a L2 itself, but it's a fundamental building block that can enable other L2s that can even potentially use like ZK-style roll-ups. But more importantly, I think BitVM helps the bridges, like the bridges between the L1 and the L2s. I think we are maybe like a year out from seeing it really working out in production. But now that we have a path that doesn't require any changes to Bitcoin L1, like that makes it very, very realistic and practical. Like before that a lot of people would rightly criticize that if your L2 requires changes from the Bitcoin L1, you're probably never going to get those changes. But with BitVM, or the work that we're doing with sBTC, we don't require any changes from Bitcoin L1. So I think that becomes a much more pragmatic, practical solution that people know. It's going to ship, it's going to work. And I think that just changes the game.A lot of folks are interested in Bitcoin now because of the approval of the spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., but what do you think needs to happen to get a mainstream audience more interested in some of the other facets of the Bitcoin network?Ali: I look at spot ETFs as bitcoin's use as a digital gold, or a store of value, like you're passively, sort of like, holding your Bitcoin. And I think for the mainstream users, one thing I'd love to see is more wallets like Leather or Xverse. These are kind of like next-generation web wallets for Bitcoin. They have big built in support for L2s. And I think they can expose people to actively using their Bitcoin. So in my mind, the model is that if you're using Bitcoin on the L1, maybe you have a hardware wallet, you're doing self-custody, or you just buy through an ETF. That's sort of like the store of value digital gold use case. But when you're using your Bitcoin in a wallet like Leather or Xverse, which is like a modern web wallet, then you're doing interesting things with it. You might be able to swap against a stablecoin or purchase an Ordinal or an NFT, or participate in some smart contracts. And that's, I think, the more and more users that we see that are using Bitcoin in that modern way, I think that could be very exciting because once you like use it, you can almost like touch and feel it and then you get the idea of like how powerful this technology is versus just passively holding.Edited by Bradley Keoun."

The advance is consistent with the cryptocurrency's record of chalking out impressive rallies in the weeks leading up to the mining reward halving. The Bitcoin blockchain's fourth halving, due in April, will reduce the per-block emission to 3.125 BTC.While the consensus is that that event, coupled with the strong inflows into the U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), implies a supply-demand imbalance and potential for a continued move higher, some traders have started to position for a sharp decline. They have begun snapping up bitcoin puts, or options to sell, at strike prices well below the going market rate because perpetual funding rates point to a market that's overheated and may witness a correction, a drop of more than 10%.A put option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.

We have not seen RSI this overbought AND bitcoin trading at these absolute levels, ever,” analysts at The Market Ear said in Thursday’s edition of the newsletter.“Chasing it here looks like a very late trade,” analysts added.RSI, developed by J. Welles Wilder, is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements over a set period, usually 14 days or 14 weeks.A reading above 70 reflects overbought conditions or a situation where the asset's price has seen a long run of successively higher prices or rallied a little too fast and may correct lower soon.The RSI indicates overbought conditions. (The Market Ear, Refinitiv) (The Market Ear, Refinitiv)Never before has the RSI reached this high, alongside plus $60,000 bitcoin price. The indicator peaked between 65 and 75 the last time bitcoin traded above $60,000 in early 2021 and November 2021.Bitcoin’s present value relative to the RSI lends credibility to the overbought signal, calling caution on the part of speculators looking for a long entry at the going market rate.That said, RSI is not the holy grail. Markets often maintain a strong upward trajectory for days and weeks, keeping the RSI above 70 for a prolonged time. As Newton’s law says, “An object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.”The overbought reading is of little importance to existing or new long-term investors whose strategy is to buy and hold for long-term growth. Investors typically do not worry about short-term price swings and focus on the big picture.According to analysts, bitcoin’s big picture is bullish, thanks to the halving, which reduces supply expansion by 50% every four years, and Wall Street’s recent embrace of the spot bitcoin ETFs.

        "content": "The number of BTC held in wallets tied to crypto miners has declined by 8,426 this year, extending the slide that began in October.Impending reward halving and the dry season in China might explain why miners are running down their coin stashes.The number of bitcoin (BTC) held by crypto miners has dropped to the lowest level since July 2021 as they run down their coin stashes ahead of the programmed halving of the revenue earned per block.Data tracked by Glassnode shows the estimated number of BTC held in wallets tied to miners fell by 8,426 BTC ($530 million) since the start of the year to 1,812,482 BTC. The decline began in the second half of October, when miners held over 1.83 million BTC.Miners create valid blocks, adding transaction records to the public ledger, or the blockchain. New coins emitted with each block are given to miners as a reward for the work. They also receive transaction fees.Currently, the miners receive 6.25 BTC per block. The halving, a quadrennial event due in April, will reduce that figure to 3.125 BTC, cutting per-block revenue by 50%. To improve profitability, miners may be using their stored BTC to buy more efficient equipment so that running costs drop, said FRNT Financial, a crypto platform based in Toronto.Read more: How the ‘Halving’ Could Impact Bitcoin\"Miners may also be inclined to sell in order to better position ahead of the halving,\" FRNT Financial said in a Tuesday newsletter. \"This may involve purchasing more efficient mining equipment due to new economics the halving will bring.\"The estimated number of BTC held in wallets tied to miners has dropped to the lowest since mid-2021.  (Glassnode)The halving is widely seen as a stress test for miners, as it is expected to reduce revenues and boost production costs simultaneously. Industry consolidation is possible.The prolonged dry season in the southwest of China, which typically extends from October to March/April, could be another reason for the decline in the miners' bitcoin balances. China accounts for roughly 20% of the total computing power on the Bitcoin network.\"Miners in some Chinese regions are known to bring online additional hardware during the wet season when hydro power becomes abundant. Conceivably, miners may sell during the dry season to counteract the inactivity of mining hardware,\" FRNT Financial said.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose 9.5% Wednesday, extending the two-day winning streak.Analysts foresee a continued move higher into six figures in the coming months.The market-neutral bitcoin cash and carry offers 14% annualized return, according to Glassnode.Bitcoin (BTC) surged 9.5% on Wednesday, registering its biggest single-day percentage gain since Oct. 23, according to charting platform TradingView.Prices rose to $64,000 on several exchanges, reaching the highest since November 2021. The parabolic move from Monday’s low of near $51,500 has been widely attributed to Wall Street’s embrace of the spot-based bitcoin ETFs. The CoinDesk 20 Index, the broader market gauge, has risen over 10% this week.The consensus is that the rally will continue in the coming months, taking prices into six figures.“Our analysis forecasts a conservative price objective of $100,000-$120,000 to be achieved by Q4 2024, and the cycle peak to be achieved sometime in 2025 in terms of total crypto market capitalization,” analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex said.“The ETFs have introduced ‘passive demand’ which means demand is coming from investors that is largely price agnostic. They perceive bitcoin as a store of value rather than a tradable volatile asset, which has been the case for several years before the introduction of the ETFs,” analysts added.Early this week, technical analysis pundit Peter Brandt said bitcoin could peak at $200,000 by September 2025.These forecasts are sure to cheer directional traders. That said, non-directional traders need not feel left out, as the cash and carry arbitrage now yields three times more than the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, the so-called risk-free rate.Cash and carry arbitrage is a market-neutral strategy that seeks to profit from price discrepancies in spot and futures markets. The arbitrageur combines a long position in the spot market with a short position in futures when futures trade at a premium to spot prices. As futures expiry nears, the premium evaporates, and on the day of the settlement, futures converge with spot prices, generating a relatively risk-less return to the arbitrageur.Per blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, the bitcoin cash and carry strategy, involving three-month futures, yields over 14%. That’s more than three times the 10-year Treasury yield of 4.27% and 2.8 times the 1-year Treasury yield of 5%.The relatively higher yield could attract more money to the crypto market.“The yield available in futures markets is likely to start attracting market makers back into the digital asset space, deepening market liquidity,” Glassnode said in the weekly newsletter.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Roughly a half-hour later, the remaining 2,817 BTC in the wallet were sent, leaving the wallet empty. Together they represented about $173 million worth of bitcoin.Screenshot showing one of the U.S. government wallets holding seized Bitfinex hacker funds transferring out the entire bitcoin balance in two transactions. (Arkham Intelligence)Shortly afterward, another wallet, containing about 12,300 BTC, transferred 0.01 BTC to a different unidentified address, according to Arkham, and shortly afterward the remaining BTC were sent. Those transfers represented about $750 million worth, bring the total value of the bitcoin transferred from the two wallets to about $923 million, based on the current price of the leading cryptocurrency.The motive for the transfers wasn't clear, and the Justice Department declined to comment on the purpose, but an official confirmed that they were conducted as part of legitimate law enforcement-related activities.The bitcoin moved during a volatile day of trading in the cryptocurrency, with its price hitting $60,000 for the first time since November 2021, then climbing further above $64,000 before abruptly plunging to just above $59,000. As of press time it was changing hands just above $60,000. The all-time high price, set in late 2021, was around $69,000.According to Arkham, there is another U.S. government wallet containing about 94,600 BTC of seized Bitfinex hacker funds, worth roughly $5.79 billion at the current price.The Bitfinex hack was one of the crypto industry's most notorious heists, partly due to the colorful social-media posts of Heather \"Razzlekhan\" Morgan, who was charged in the case along with Ilya Lichtenstein.According to a Justice Department press release in August, the government seized about 95,000 stolen bitcoin from crypto wallets in the defendants' control, valued about $3.6 billion at the time of the seizure.UPDATE (15:50 UTC): Adds that Justice Department confirms the transactions were conducted for legitimate law enforcement purposes.

The plaintiff, the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), hopes the trial's outcome – should it confirm Wright is not Satoshi – would end his legal battles with the broader crypto community working on Bitcoin.After Wright made a reference last week to some emails between him and his former legal representatives at Ontier, his current lawyers were compelled to submit those emails to evidence. An inconsistency forced them to check with Ontier on the accuracy of the correspondence submitted by Wright’s wife Ramona Watts. Ontier then responded the emails appeared to be “not genuine.”COPA is set to put the new allegations of forgery to Wright on Friday.Counsel for both COPA and Wright this week tried to undermine expert witnesses for the other party, particularly questioning their “independence.” Wright’s team on Monday questioned COPA expert witness Patrick Madden on why he’d enlisted the help of COPA’s counsel at Bird & Bird LLP to organize the findings of his investigation into Wright’s claims instead of seeking independent help. On Wednesday, the COPA camp, in turn, asked Wright’s expert witness ZeMing Gao, who has authored multiple essays asserting Wright is Satoshi, whether he was truly an objective expert.In addition to Gao, cryptography and security expert Sarah Meiklejohn took the stand for COPA on Wednesday to defend – among other things – her findings indicating key cryptographic signings Wright did as proof he's Satoshi may have been inadequate.After Friday, the court will resume on March 12 for closing statements from both sides.Edited by Nikhilesh De."

        "content": "When Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox collapsed in February 2014, there were well-founded fears that it could kill the nascent cryptocurrency before it was more than five years out of the cradle. It is easy now to scoff at such suggestions, but many people thought along these lines given that Bitcoin had not yet faced such a catastrophe.Mark Hunter has been an author and ghostwriter for 20 years and a leading cryptocurrency writer since 2017. He is the author of “Ultimate Catastrophe: How Mt. Gox Lost Half a Billion Dollars and Nearly Killed Bitcoin” co-creator and co-host of the podcast series “Dr Bitcoin: The Man Who Wasn't Satoshi Nakamoto.”UnmuteOver 880,000 BTC were lost by or stolen from Mt. Gox in various guises between March 2011 and January 2014, a haul worth a staggering $45 billion today, and yet with the 10th anniversary of its collapse upon us, there are still several important questions that remain unanswered.Who did it?One of the key questions that remains unknown is whether we know all of the culprits. Over 809,000 BTC were stolen across six hacks during Mt. Gox’s lifetime, and we only know of two names linked to one hack: Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner, who are accused of being part of the Russian hacking group that compromised the exchange in October 2011. Over the course of 26 months, the pair helped steal and launder 647,000 bitcoins from the exchange’s cold wallets.Verner and Bilyuchenko have only been charged by U.S. authorities with the laundering of the coins rather than the hack itself, however, which could suggest a lack of evidence against them on that charge.See also: Where the Mt. Gox Money WentApart from these allegations, sealed in 2017 and made public in June last year, we have no idea who stole the remaining 162,000 BTC. 79,956 BTC remain tied to a well-known address beginning ‘1Feex’, while 77,500 stolen in September 2011 have never been traced. This hack was so successful it was not detected until 2015.Then there’s the individual who stole 2,000 BTC in June 2011, which sent the value of bitcoin crashing from $17.50 to $0.01, and the hacker who swiped more than half the coins held by the exchange at the time, when Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpelès left the wallet on a drive with unencrypted network. Fortunately for Karpelès the hacker got cold feet and negotiated a 1% bounty, leading to a loss of just 3,000 BTC for the exchange, rather than 300,000 BTC.In all these cases we have no idea who did the deed, and it’s almost certain now that we never will. Many suspect the 1Feex hack was a dry run for the debilitating October 2011-January 2014 exploit, given that the modus operandi was the same, but this has never been confirmed.How did it happen?Of the 881,865 BTC which left Mt. Gox unintentionally, we can only say for sure how 72,409 BTC were lost. 30,000 BTC were logged as deposits to customers by Mt. Gox’s system when they were in fact being stolen by hackers. An error by Mark Karpelès in October 2011 led to 2,609 being sent to a non-existent address. Two bots operating on Mt. Gox, Markus and Willy, lost 22,800 BTC. And Karpelès bought Polish exchange Bitomat for 17,000 BTC in July 2011.When it comes to the remainder, the method of entry is generally either unknown or merely suspected. In the case of the June 2011 hack, we know that the hacker was able to get access to the Mt. Gox server through an administrator-level account. This was initially attributed to auditor Auden McKernan but it was later revealed that it was the account of Jed McCaleb, the founder who had sold Mt. Gox to Mark Karpelès, which inexplicably still had administrator privileges. It is thought that the hacker obtained the details when the entire Mt. Gox user database was stolen along with the 79,956 BTC in the 1Feex hack.See also: Why Bitcoin's Greatest Hack Still Matters: The Legacy of Mt. Gox Given that U.S. authorities were confident in naming Verner and Bilyuchenko as being part of a group that hacked into Mt. Gox in October 2011 they must have some evidence to back up their assertions, but unless it ever comes to a trial (which is almost certainly won’t now that their names are public) these details will likely never be divulged.How safe were the Mt. Gox bitcoins?Related to the question of how the hackers gained access to the Mt. Gox servers is the question of how they were then able to access the funds supposedly securely stored in cold wallets. We know that until the June 2011 hack, Karpelès kept users’ bitcoins in a haphazard manner across various physical and software wallets, which exacerbated the impact of the hacks and prolonged the cleanup.Karpelès claims that this incident led him to incorporate a much more secure system: he split the coins across numerous paper wallets (he later said hundreds of pieces of paper were involved) and stashed them in bank vaults and safety deposit boxes around Tokyo. Therefore, if the hot wallet was stolen again, as it was for the 1Feex hack, the cold wallets should not be affected.This seems safe enough in itself, but when it was revealed that the exchange’s cold wallets had indeed been ransacked between October 2011 and January 2014, many started to ask questions, including then Bitcoin blogger and future General Partner at crypto investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, Arianna Simpson:“If you’re doing it right, the cold storage should not be accessible via the hot wallet, leak or no leak. That’s the whole point of separating the two.”So how were the cold wallets compromised? Karpelès has never confirmed his bespoke cold wallet-hot wallet setup, potentially to avoid lawsuits based on the mishandling of funds, but he has given hints in interviews that paint an inconsistent and at times illogical scenario.The only way to safely top up a hot wallet with funds from a paper wallet is to go and get the paper wallet and execute a multi-step manual transaction on an ultra-secure network. This must be done every single time, which is of course entirely impractical for any Bitcoin exchange no matter what its size or trading volume. No Mt. Gox staff member has reported seeing Mark Karpelès handling paper wallets, and indeed some prominent members of staff told me for “Ultimate Catastrophe: How Mt. Gox Lost Half a Billion Dollars and Nearly Killed Bitcoin” that they had only ever heard hot wallets mentioned, never cold wallets.See also: Mt. Gox Bitcoin (BTC) Payments Move CloserWas there, therefore, a system that automatically topped up the hot wallet from the cold wallets when it ran dry and vice versa? This seems to be the only feasible way in which the exchange could have operated, although it totally undermines the principles of a cold wallet system.Did Mark Karpelès know the exchange was broke?This is the big question that still divides opinion. Naturally, Karpelès insists that he didn’t know the exchange had been bled dry until he checked the cold wallets in mid-February 2014, but there are flaws with this claim. Mt. Gox had started experiencing bitcoin withdrawal issues as far back as August 2013, which should have raised red flags. And yet Karpelès seems not to have considered Mt. Gox was underfunded, despite the exchange having been the victim of multiple hacks in its lifetime.Karpelès was quick to blame the “transaction malleability” bug when it emerged in early 2014 as the reason for withdrawal issues, but this was known to require a tremendous amount of social engineering to pull off even a small theft. He also said he didn’t suspect any losses because there was a monitoring system in place. If such a system existed then it wasn’t designed properly, which is indicative of the kind of mismanagement that plagued the exchange.Needless to say, there are plenty who refuse to believe that Karpelès only discovered the loss in February 2014. Others go further in saying Karpelès not only knew about the missing bitcoins, but used Willy and Markus to make up the loss. If this was Karpelès’ intention it backfired spectacularly: the pair lost 22,800 BTC and $51.6 million between them before the exchange collapsed.The simple answer is that we can only speculate as to how the bitcoins on Mt. Gox were secured, and unless Mark Karpelès deigns to tell us it will remain that way."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesCoinDesk Indices (CoinDesk Indices)Top StoriesBitcoin’s near-vertical rise continues, with the cryptocurrency scaling the $59,000 mark early Wednesday. Ether (ETH) topped $3,300, and the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader market, jumped 3.5% to $2,177. The bears, if any, have been put on notice as bitcoin (BTC) is now just 16% short of challenging the record high of $69,000. The distance could be covered easily before April’s mining reward halving, assuming Wall Street continues pouring money into the spot exchange-traded funds, maintaining the demand-supply imbalance. That said, the market increasingly looks overheated, not only in terms of funding rates, but also because, as Santiment data show, the top trending cryptocurrency on social media in the past 24 hours is PEPE. The meme token’s market cap has skyrocketed by 153% this week, CoinDesk data show. Such frenzied action in smaller coins often presages market-wide price pullbacks. While past performance is no guarantee of future behavior, some traders have started purchasing bitcoin puts to hedge potential downside risks.BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Tuesday set a record high of $1.36 billion in trading volume, surpassing Monday's $1.3 billion tally, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The ETF, which trades under the ticker IBIT on Nasdaq, saw nearly 42 million shares change hands, more than double its lifetime average. While high volume is often perceived as bullish, it's not necessarily the case, according to NYDIG's global head of research, Greg Cipolaro, who prefers to track the ratio between the dollar trading volume and the fund's net asset value. \"This ratio shows the proportion of the fund's assets traded on any given day, offering a glimpse into the investor and trader profiles and potentially what motivates their investment choices,\" Cipolaro wrote.While Wall Street has embraced digital assets, \"the powers that be\" maintain their tough stance. In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) called out the crypto industry for being reluctant to follow the rules that guide the U.S. financial system. \"I wanna collaborate with the industry, what I don't understand is why the industry seems to be saying that the only way that they can survive is if there's plenty of space for the drug traffickers and the human traffickers, oh and the terrorist, and the ransomware scammer, and the consumer scammers …,\" Warren said.Chart of the DayWeekly transactions on Scroll.

Like it's the pristine asset.\"\"Stacks Nakamoto launch is only a few months out at this point, then I think the developers can program anything that they want.\"\"There are new experiments coming.\"There's a buzz around Bitcoin these days, and it's got as much to do with the development taking place on the original blockchain – once seen as a sleepy and ultra-conservative ecosystem compared with Ethereum, and its higher frequency of upgrades and greater programmability – as with the newly approved spot bitcoin ETFs that have pulled in billions of dollars from investors.Bitcoin the cryptocurrency is in the midst of a powerful rally, headed for a sixth straight monthly gain, its longest such streak in three years. With a market capitalization of $1.12 trillion, bitcoin (BTC) accounts for roughly half the value of all cryptocurrencies; put another way, it's worth as much as all other digital assets combined.But it's the newfound spirit of development that's got engineers and programmers including Muneeb Ali, CEO of Trust Machines and co-creator of the Stacks project, suddenly hitting the talking circuit. Top blockchain tech podcasts are airing episodes about the prospects for Bitcoin layer-2 networks, analysts are scurrying to assess the potential, NFT-like digital art on Bitcoin are fetching tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and there's even a new venture-capital fund to plunk down money into Bitcoin DeFi projects.CoinDesk's Jenn Sanasie interviewed Ali, who has a Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University, about the flurry of activity, and what he sees as the real breakthroughs that are making it all possible, and what he expects to come of it all. He also spoke about the Stacks project's much-anticipated Nakamoto upgrade, tipped to drastically improve the speed.The interview was transcribed by Bradley Keoun and lightly edited for clarity.What are you watching in the news these days?Ali: One of the news items recently that caught my eye was a recent funding round of EigenLayer. So they raised around $100 million from A16Z. I think the thing that interests me about that particular protocol is that it's looking at capital that's locked on ETH and trying to find interesting use cases for it. How can you reuse the locked capital? And I'm very interested in seeing these types of primitives evolve around Bitcoin as well.We know that Bitcoin is sort of like the apex predator. Like it's the pristine asset. And these types of concepts coming to Bitcoin could be much more significant because Bitcoin is a trillion dollars in capital. And we are just seeing the start of people locking their BTC capital into smart contracts running on L2s and so on. And I think if we can provide people with increased flexibility, where they could lock BTC in a contract, but then potentially reuse it in other interesting ways, obviously it comes with risks and all.EigenLayer is a really hot topic lately, really exciting project that everyone is talking about. How difficult would it be to bring something like this to Bitcoin, and what kind of timeline would we be looking at to see this kind of development in the Bitcoin ecosystem?Ali: I think the main difficulty in bringing these types of protocols to Bitcoin has always been at the L2 infrastructure layer. So there are two parts to it. One is, what's the consensus mechanism for the L2? Is it really secured by Bitcoin? That's work that, for example, Stacks has done with the Stacks Nakamoto launch, where your transactions are secured by 100% of Bitcoin hashpower. And the second thing is how secure it is to move your BTC from L1 into L2.And over there, Stacks has done some work with sBTC, but other projects like BitVM actually reduced the trust assumptions significantly. So I think we're making progress on both those two sort of like critical infrastructure points. Once that's done, and I think we are very close, Stacks Nakamoto launch is only a few months out at this point, then I think the developers can program anything that they want within the L2 environment. So that's sort of like the exciting part, that once these infrastructure challenges are behind us, I think we can unlock a lot of creativity by developers using BTC as the asset.For so long, Bitcoin was an ecosystem that was relatively unchanged, right? Sitting here in 2024, talking about these developments, how does it feel to be sitting here and talking about Bitcoin evolving at such a rapid pace?Ali: I think that's definitely interesting. I would say that from where I stand, it definitely took longer than I expected. For example, I mean, we knew that ecosystems outside of Bitcoin can move faster, they can take more risks, and they can innovate faster as well. But you can sort of watch some of those experiments and the stuff that's working out. For example, one clear example would be stablecoins. At this point, we know stablecoins work. They have clear product market fit, people want them, people want to use them, then these primitives would come to Bitcoin. I think the coming-to-Bitcoin part was slower than we anticipated, but it definitely feels good that it's finally happening. And I think Ordinals and Casey [Rodarmor], they deserve a lot of credit. Like, I do think when Ordinals started, that was sort of like the spark whereBitcoin culture started changing, the amount of developers and capital coming into Bitcoin started changing. And then some of the OG projects like Stacks and others who are already working, I think they got some sort of a fresh fuel on the fire as well. And people saw that, look, a lot of this stuff is already built or almost there, and now developers are getting really excited about it. So I think in some ways, I'm glad that we took the slow and steady approach, that we're still around to see the innovation coming back to Bitcoin, and I think that's an exciting time to be here.Let's talk a little bit more about Stacks. You mentioned the Nakamoto upgrade that's coming up soon. Talk to me about your focus for Stacks as we move further into 2024 and what we can expect from the upgrade.Ali: As Bitcoiners, we definitely have a different set of values. There is definitely much more long-term thinking. There's definitely aversion to taking needless risks. So I think the Stacks L2 project basically represents a lot of that. For example, a lot of R&D work went into designing really safe programming languages. Similarly, on the consensus side, a ton of work went into reusing Bitcoin's hash power as much as possible, or reusing Bitcoin security as much as possible. I think it definitely shows that long-term thinking. So the Nakamoto launch has been in the works, I would say at this point, almost like two years. And a lot of challenges, frankly, were operating as a decentralized ecosystem. Again, going back to the ethos of Bitcoin, the Stacks L2 ecosystem itself is heavily decentralized. I think there are like 10-plus different entities that are contributing to some of the core software and there are like 20 or more outside of that as well. And sometimes there is a lot of overhead and challenges in functioning as a decentralized ecosystem, but I think it's better for the long-term health as well. So with the Stacks Nakamoto, things are finally coming together and maybe the timing would work out as well. A lot of devs are excited about doing the launch of Nakamoto, which is basically a much faster L2 that is secured by 100% of Bitcoin hashpower.And so people are looking forward to that increase in speed and functionality. But the timing might be very interesting because right now it's scheduled for approximately when Bitcoin halving is happening. And I think that would be sort of interesting because Bitcoin, there's a lot of attention on Bitcoin during the halving time. And if the major L2 is doing a launch around the same time, I think that'd be very exciting.I'll be on the edge of my seat waiting for that. Let's talk a little bit about Bitcoin scalability. Layer 2s are really meant to solve some of the scalability challenges with the network. Talk to me about if that's happening, what still needs to happen.Ali: Let's say that at a rough approximation, you know, 100 million people use Bitcoin. I think the numbers are off, depending on, like, what data set you use, but let's say approximately it's 100 million people right now. To get to a billion people, we know for sure that it's not going to happen on the Bitcoin L1. Like there's basically no way, right? Like if they wouldn't be able to own a UTXO on-chain. So we absolutely need these L2 solutions.And one of the things that has changed in the last one year is that, before, the Bitcoin community was sort of putting all of the scalability eggs in the same basket, which was Lightning. And don't get me wrong, Lightning is amazing. I think some of the companies there have done groundbreaking work. They're growing, they're actually getting more nodes online. But interestingly, over the last one year, this sort of attitude has shifted to, Let's try all sorts of experiments as L2s. And this is something that happened with Ethereum. We see almost like 10 to 20 big projects. But in terms of experiments that people tried, it would probably be 100 or 200 or more. And some of them didn't work out. Some of them became bigger projects with more traction, more capital, more developers, and so on. And now we are beginning to see that with Bitcoin. There's obviously Stacks and Rootstock, which are the more OGs. But there are a fresh batch of new L2s coming up. That is very, very exciting.Because what happens is you let the free markets try different designs, and then people are tweaking things. They're trying different iterations and remixes of different ideas. And the probability that at least a few of them are going to work is actually much, much higher than putting all of your eggs in the same basket. So I think with that happening, my confidence level that we will have some L2s that are actually sort of working out commercially in the market and taking a lot of load off of Bitcoin L1, where the experience is great, people can do fast, cheap transactions and infrastructure sort of goes in the background. That's like where we want to be, where Bitcoin infrastructure is just in the background, it's reliable, people just can do fast, cheap payments and it sort of works all the time. And I think with these new experiments, I think some of the L2s would definitely be able to deliver on that.Ordinals have really revived the NFT narrative. And it's interesting that that came from the Bitcoin ecosystem. Do you think that we're going to see some of that traction that we saw with Ethereum come over to Bitcoin?Ali: I'll separate out the two things here. One about Ordinals. I'm of the view that usually when something finds product market fit, there is like one core property that sort of stands out and people just get it, right? Often it's like something very simple. For the case of Bitcoin as money, it's 21 million coins. It's as simple as that. People know that there only ever will be 21 million coins, and it's durable, it's not gonna change, and people get it. It's a very simple thing. And if you look at Ethereum, they've tried very complicated arguments around ultrasound money and how, you know, supply is changing and this and that, and that complicated thing is actually not working. The simple, there will only be 21 million coins is actually what's working in the market.Same with NFTs when I look at it. Yes, there are many other factors, but just the fact that with Ordinals, the image is literally on the chain. And it's not on any chain, it's on Bitcoin, right? We know that Bitcoin is going to be around. I think that one property just stands out. Like people just feel that, you know, this is real, this thing is never gonna disappear, and my digital art is now stored forever. And that's it. Like I think that's the base level property. And then there are obviously other things around it that are leading to a lot of sort of interest there. And I think with Bitcoin DeFi, which is the main thing that gets enabled by L2s, we'll again see these simple primitives. For example, one I can think of is a lot of people don't want to sell their Bitcoin. So a very simple primitive could be, Hey, don't sell your Bitcoin, but lock it in a decentralized way and get some liquidity. Take a stablecoin loan. Again, a simple concept that a lot of people get, and they can start using it. I think that's how you start getting a lot of product market fit.And now coming to your second question, I do think that in the overall industry right now, there's a lot of capital and developers who have the model that there will be some alt L1 like a Solana or something else, they're going to start eating on Ethereum's market share. I think there's some truth to it. Solana is gaining a lot of traction and it's popular in developers and so on. But I think what the market is beginning to see right now is that there's a much bigger category, which is Bitcoin L2s, because these Bitcoin L2s can match the alt L1s or Ethereum head-to-head on every single feature. It could be speed, it could be expressivity, and so on, but they can match it. And I think that could potentially be a much bigger market simply because of the fact that they're not starting from zero. Like whenever you launch a new project, you're sort starting from zero in terms of how much capital there is in that ecosystem. When you launch a Bitcoin L2, you're launching something on top of a trillion dollars of capital, right? So I think there's a much easier path to that capital getting deployed and Bitcoin L2s as a category growing. So I do think they're going to start giving Eth L2s some competition, but even like Eth L1 might start seeing competition coming from Bitcoin L2s, which is something that I don't think a lot of people are talking about.Besides Stacks, what Bitcoin L2 are you watching? What Bitcoin L2 is doing something very innovative that you're keeping your eye on?Ali: The landscape right now, what it looks like is, uh, there are the big four, which is Stacks, Rootstock, Lightning and Liquid. And they're all sort of, very different, right? Liquid is a federation. Lightning is mostly for payments and a peer-to-peer thing. I think Rootstock and Stacks would qualify as, what the Ethereum or Solana developers expect from an L2. Right? So those are the two bigger ones.And then there are new experiments coming. I think Babylon is one. They're doing something very interesting with enabling Bitcoin to be locked at the L1 level and you're sort of like participating in proof-of-stake on other chains. I think that's a very interesting model. Some people have worked on things called Spiderchains, which are, again, interesting. The common trend there is trying to reuse BTC capital. They can't take Bitcoin capital and participate in becoming a validator on an L2 or some other ecosystem out there.And I'll come back to the project that I'm very, very excited about, which is BitVM. It's not something that is a L2 itself, but it's a fundamental building block that can enable other L2s that can even potentially use like ZK-style roll-ups. But more importantly, I think BitVM helps the bridges, like the bridges between the L1 and the L2s. I think we are maybe like a year out from seeing it really working out in production. But now that we have a path that doesn't require any changes to Bitcoin L1, like that makes it very, very realistic and practical. Like before that a lot of people would rightly criticize that if your L2 requires changes from the Bitcoin L1, you're probably never going to get those changes. But with BitVM, or the work that we're doing with sBTC, we don't require any changes from Bitcoin L1. So I think that becomes a much more pragmatic, practical solution that people know. It's going to ship, it's going to work. And I think that just changes the game.A lot of folks are interested in Bitcoin now because of the approval of the spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., but what do you think needs to happen to get a mainstream audience more interested in some of the other facets of the Bitcoin network?Ali: I look at spot ETFs as bitcoin's use as a digital gold, or a store of value, like you're passively, sort of like, holding your Bitcoin. And I think for the mainstream users, one thing I'd love to see is more wallets like Leather or Xverse. These are kind of like next-generation web wallets for Bitcoin. They have big built in support for L2s. And I think they can expose people to actively using their Bitcoin. So in my mind, the model is that if you're using Bitcoin on the L1, maybe you have a hardware wallet, you're doing self-custody, or you just buy through an ETF. That's sort of like the store of value digital gold use case. But when you're using your Bitcoin in a wallet like Leather or Xverse, which is like a modern web wallet, then you're doing interesting things with it. You might be able to swap against a stablecoin or purchase an Ordinal or an NFT, or participate in some smart contracts. And that's, I think, the more and more users that we see that are using Bitcoin in that modern way, I think that could be very exciting because once you like use it, you can almost like touch and feel it and then you get the idea of like how powerful this technology is versus just passively holding.Edited by Bradley Keoun."

Per Brandt, the bullish view will remain valid while prices exceed the past week’s low of around $50,500.Several other studies suggest a steep bull run ahead, including those based on previous halving cycles and technical analysis indicators like the Bollinger bandwidth.The consensus is that halving could continue to drive inflows into the U.S.-based spot BTC ETFs, sending prices at least into six figures over the next 12 months. Bitcoin’s reward halving, a quadrennial event due in April, will lower the rate at which coins are generated to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.Bitcoin's price chart. (Peter Brandt, TradingView) (Peter Brandt, TradingView)Brandt’s bullish post on X has some market participants toying with the idea of updating their profile pictures with “laser eyes” – a viral X meme that bitcoin holders used during the bull market of 2021 to suggest a perpetual market rally.According to Brandt, the return of the laser eyes would be a contrary indicator, signaling retail investor mania, often observed at market tops.“Just as I did in 2021, I will use laser eyes on ‘X’ as a contrary indicator. So, people, if you want bitcoin to remain in a strong trend please do not adopt laser eyes on your social media picture. Too many laser eyes will be the KOD,” Brandt warned.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Data from CoinGlass show short bets have lost over $180 million since Sunday. Still, open interest jumped from $48 billion to nearly $54 billion – showing a rise in bullish bets as traders expected volatility.Liquidation is when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a margin shortfall. It happens when a trader lacks sufficient funds to keep the trade open.Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.The bitcoin bump buoyed the broader crypto market. Ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA rose 8% in the past 24 hours, while Stacks (STX) – a bitcoin layer-2 token – spiked over 25%.Market observers said bitcoin is firmly in a “new bull market” and could see a significant upside as the anticipated halving event approaches.“Bitcoin’s decisive rally signals the de facto start of a new bull market,” said Alex Adelman, founder at Lolli, in an email to CoinDesk. “Major price movements are being driven by sheer positive market sentiment and persistent bitcoin ETF inflows, which reached new daily highs with the day’s rally.”“With the bitcoin halving just over a month away, which historically brings price increases, tremendous upside lies ahead for bitcoin,” Adelman added.Halving is part of the Bitcoin network’s code to reduce inflationary pressure on the cryptocurrency and will cut the rewards in half for successfully mining a bitcoin block. This makes obtaining or mining new bitcoin much harder and has historically preceded bull runs.Edited by Omkar Godbole."

That’s driving the cost of holding leveraged bullish bets in perpetual futures skywards, creating an attractive arbitrage opportunity for non-directional traders.Early Tuesday, bitcoin (BTC) rose nearly to $57,000, the highest since late 2021, taking the year-to-date gain to 32%, CoinDesk data show. The CoinDesk 20 index, a broader market gauge, traded nearly 6% higher.The annualized funding rate in bitcoin perpetual futures listed on Binance surpassed 100% for the first time in at least a year, according to data source Velo Data and CoinGlass. Funding rates on Bybit and Deribit rose to 95% and 56%, respectively.Perpetuals or futures with no expiry use funding rates to keep prices for perpetuals in sync with the spot prices. A positive funding rate indicates that perpetuals are trading at a premium to the spot price and requires traders holding long or buy positions to pay a fee to those holding short positions. Exchanges collect funding every eight hours.In other words, a positive and rising funding rate indicates a bullish mood in the market or that the leverage is skewed bullish.Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, said the rising funding rates likely stem from traders taking bullish bets in anticipation of continued inflows into the U.S.-based spot ETFs.“The perp funding rates are exploding, while open interest keeps climbing, now at $14.4 billion,” Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, who predicted bitcoin’s rise to $57,000, said. “Traders are becoming increasingly confident that the halving and the ETF inflows will be bullish.”Bitcoin: Annualized perpetual funding rates (Velo Data) (Velo Data)Thielen added that the surge in funding rates means non-directional traders or arbitrageurs stand to make an attractive return.Arbitrage involves profiting from price discrepancies between the two markets. An elevated funding rate means perpetuals are trading at a significant premium to the spot price. An arbitrageur, therefore, can short perpetual futures and buy the cryptocurrency in the spot market, pocketing the premium while bypassing the price volatility risks.“Elevated perpetual futures funding rates are providing crypto hedge funds with exceptionally high arb spreads. BTC and ETH are trading at 20% and 30% or even higher, and this is the sweet spot for ARB books. In this market, everybody wins, the guys that are outright long and the guys that are playing the perp spread. A wonderful time to be in crypto!” Thielen told CoinDesk.Edited by Shaurya Malwa."

        "content": "Correspondence between Satoshi Nakamoto and his earliest known collaborator, Martti Malmi, was released as part of an ongoing lawsuit in the United Kingdom regarding the true identity of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator. For some, the documents represent a new avenue of research for anyone looking to finally identify who Satoshi really is. For others, the 120 pages of emails (also posted to Github) offer fresh insight into the character and personality of the long gone developer.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteAs Bitcoin historian (and former CoinDesk editor) Pete Rizzo notes, the emails largely conform to and confirm what the world already knows about Satoshi, who between 2009 and 2011 was an active participant on message boards like BitcoinTalk and the Cryptography mailing list, and who cataloged his thoughts in a formal white paper.See also: Stupid Things Craig Wright Said in His Latest Stupid Trial | OpinionHowever, new information has come to light via the document dump, including Satoshi’s attempts to support early Bitcoin developers, his anxieties about developing a Bitcoin use case and his prescience in anticipating some of the biggest debates that have defined Bitcoin’s development, including over block size and energy consumption.Here are five things Satoshi Nakamoto predicted about Bitcoin, before stepping away from the project.Debates take energyProof-of-work, the algorithm backing Bitcoin, is a fundamentally wasteful process by design. Even back in the days of Satoshi, people realized that, if Bitcoin were to become successful, the hashpower directed towards securing the network would be massive. Satoshi anticipated this debate and responded to critics, writing, “ironic if we end up having to choose between economic liberty and conservation.”In his message to Malmi, Satoshi notes that Bitcoin can only be truly peer-to-peer “without a trusted third party,” unlike the centralized attempts at electronic money that preceded the first cryptocurrency. “If it did grow to consume significant energy, I think it would still be less wasteful than the labour [sic] and resource intensive conventional banking activity it would replace,” he wrote.Indeed, Galaxy Research published a report that found the global banking system gets through 263 terawatt hours a year, or twice what the Bitcoin network uses.Rule of lawToday, bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency recognized by U.S. financial regulators to be unquestionably a commodity, because of the network’s decentralized design and lack of a clear stakeholder. But in its early days, Satoshi must have been keenly aware of the shadow casted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the longarm of U.S. law.This might be why Satoshi took precautions around discussing bitcoin as an investment, even if he did once say “It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.” Satoshi told Malmi that he was “uncomfortable” with language on Bitcoin’s sourceforge telling people to “consider it an investment.” He said it was okay if people came to the realization on their own, but that they should be wary of “pitching” it.Not so anonymousSimilarly, privacy advocate Satoshi realized very early on that Bitcoin wasn’t an anonymous technology, even if he tried to design it to be. At best, Satoshi wrote, Bitcoin can be pseudonymous if people take the appropriate precautions (like never reusing key pairs) and being careful not to link Bitcoin transactions to their real-world identities. He also worried it made Bitcoin sound \"shady.\"Today, considering that most people acquire bitcoin via exchanges that are legally required to implement know-your-customer procedures to identify users, it’s hard to remain private while using Bitcoin. It’s unclear if Satoshi saw this coming — especially because Bitcoin was designed to obviate the need for intermediaries like exchanges — but he was still considering describing Bitcoin as private, lest it mislead users and sow distrust of the project.“I think we should de-emphasize the anonymous angle,” he wrote to Malmi, who had said Bitcoin “can be kept hidden” in an FAQ (a point Satoshi praised for being “carefully” worded). “I think the people who want anonymous [sic] will still figure it out without us trumpeting it.”Any use cases?Satoshi and Malmi frequently discussed potential uses of Bitcoin, knowing that the network needed a killer use case or application to drive adoption. Generally speaking, Satoshi noted the timestamping features of the blockchain, which could be used to help authenticate events in the real world.But Satoshi also thought about bitcoin’s position within the world of digital payments, and thought it could be used to create more liquid markets around existing digital currencies like Liberty Reserve (now defunct). He predicted that people wanting to improve their privacy could go from bitcoin to liberty reserve to dollars, gold or PayPal, given that at the time it was easy to generate BTC just by mining.One avenue that Satoshi correctly predicted would be bitcoin’s viability for buying gift cards (which he referred to as “paysafecards”), which today is one of the most common uses of bitcoin.Developer patronageRizzo noted that the emails also give insight into one of the earliest financial backers of Bitcoin, which was fully bootstrapped by Satoshi and never took in VC capital. According to a back-and-forth over the course of months, Satoshi reveals that he has found an anonymous donor interested in donating between $2,000 and $3,600 to support development of Bitcoin. While it took some time for the mysterious and still-unknown benefactor to send the cash (via post) to Malmi, the money did go towards paying for website hosting costs and other incidentals.See also: Nic Carter – Bitcoin's Patronage System Is an Unheralded Strength | OpinionWhile this isn’t a massive financial windfall, securing funds to offset the costs of volunteer work by developers shows — perhaps for the first time — that Satoshi was aware of challenges of supporting open-source development.“It might be a long time before we get another donation like that, we should save a lot of it,” he wrote. Malmi was also told to take $1,000 of the donation to put towards an exchange he was developing, which could have helped support the BTC-USD exchange rate (then worth just a few cents).If anything, this anticipates the current state of Bitcoin development patronage, which is still ad hoc and arguably insufficient. While it’s becoming more common for firms like Block, MicroStrategy and others to sponsor Bitcoin developers, over the years a number of contributors have walked away from the costly labor of love.Satoshi notes at several points that he is often too busy with work to put as much time and attention towards Bitcoin as deserved. Heis thankful that developers like Malmi and Satoshi’s handpicked successor, Gavin Andresen, were around to carry the project forth."

Meanwhile, retail users have a lower concentration in these assets and a higher tilt towards altcoins, the report added.Ether, which is now trading above $3,100, has outperformed bitcoin with a 33% rally year-to-date, driven by factors such as its deflationary supply since the shift to proof-of-stake, low levels of ETH held on exchanges, and increased staking activity.In a recent report, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra also highlighted the growth of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem and layer-2 networks, as well as the anticipated Dencun upgrade, as key catalysts for ETH's performance compared to the world's largest digital asset.Read more: Ethereum Developers Target March 13 for Milestone 'Dencun' Upgrade on MainnetThis market sentiment had changed from December when Bybit published its last report, which showed that institutions were bullish on bitcoin, mixed on ether, and were moving more of their ether and altcoin holdings into bitcoin in anticipation of the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) ETF being approved.Bitcoin is up 20% since the beginning of the year, according to CoinDesk Indicies data, outpacing the performance of the CoinDesk 20, a measure of the largest digital assets, which is up 12%.Bybit also observed that Institutions have significantly reduced their altcoin positions, particularly in volatile categories like meme coins, artificial intelligence (AI), and BRC-20 tokens, despite their high returns in 2023. Instead, focusing more on stable assets like layer-1 tokens and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.AI tokens seem to be correlated with chip designer Nvidia's performance, as the GPU giant is practically synonymous with AI developments.

The documents are now set to be analyzed by lawyers for both Wright and the plaintiff, the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA).The emails were shared with the court by Wright's team after it had spent the day cross-examining digital forensics expert Patrick Madden, whose arguments that the Australian computer scientist forged key material he relies on to prove he's Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto form the basis for COPA's complaint against Wright.Madden, who has penned extensive reports questioning the authenticity of numerous documents that Wright has presented as proof, appeared flustered and often downplayed his findings.Craig Orr, who cross-examined Madden for Shoosmiths, carefully hit a handful of arguments made by Madden to try and undermine the expert's work on the investigation and the strength of his findings.When asked if he could say for sure that a footer in a document presented by Wright could or could not have existed in 2008, Madden answered: \"I can't say that 100%.\"When asked by Orr if he was speculating, Madden said, \"It's a bit more than that, but, okay.\"Later, Orr questioned why Madden had relied on COPA's counsel Bird & Bird LLP to help draft his report instead of hiring an independent assistant. Madden said he didn't trust anyone else to do the work for him.When Orr asked if he had done anything similar for other cases, Madden answered no, and later disagreed with Orr when he suggested Madden had \"undermined\" his independence by his approach to preparing for the case.Madden's planned two-day cross-examination lasted less than a day, and Shoosmiths decided against questioning two more witnesses from COPA's camp lined up for the day.

While the cryptocurrency industry points to miners' use of clean or orphaned power, which would otherwise go to waste, critics are laser-focused on the raw numbers of energy consumption it generates.As a result, some jurisdictions like New York State or British Columbia have placed moratoriums on Bitcoin mining, citing the high energy consumption.\"If it did grow to consume significant energy, I think it would still be less wasteful than the labour and resource intensive conventional banking activity it would replace,\" Satoshi wrote. \"The cost would be an order of magnitude less than the billions in banking fees that pay for all those brick-and-mortar buildings, skyscrapers, and junk mail credit card offers.\"2021 research from Galaxy Digital showed that Bitcoin uses half the energy of the banking or gold mining industries.\"Ironic if we end up having to choose between economic liberty and conservation,\" Satoshi continued.Non-financial uses of BlockchainBlockchain serving as a sort of open-source notary was one non-financial use of Bitcoin that Satoshi saw in the technology, which would allow users to securely timestamp documents to prove their existence at a specific point in time.\"Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for transactions,\" Satoshi wrote. \"A few lines of code could create a transaction with an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.\"Legal concernsSatoshi was also concerned that labelling Bitcoin as a sort of investment might bring legal scrutiny from authorities.\"There are a lot of things you can say on the sourceforge site that I can't say on my own site,\" he wrote. \"Even so, I'm uncomfortable with explicitly saying, 'consider it an investment' ... That's a dangerous thing to say and you should delete that bullet point. It's OK if they come to that conclusion on their own, but we can't pitch it as that.\"Indeed, in the time since, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has engaged in a long campaign of legal warfare around the use of this word and might classify a cryptocurrency as a security and crypto exchanges as dealing with unregistered securities.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

        "content": "“Welcome home.”That’s what Thomas Pacchia said to me as I entered his bar, PubKey, located below street level in Greenwich Village, New York City, one frigid night in late-2023.Pacchia’s words resonated deeply with me, as I hadn’t yet realized how much I’d come to appreciate that the bar had begun to feel like a home away from home — or at least an oasis — in a jurisdiction that many Bitcoin enthusiasts have fled in the wake of both the implementation of the BitLicense and the onset of COVID.Thursday night meetups and programming at PubKey (a play on the term “public key,” a technology that uses asymmetric encryption to validate data on Bitcoin) have become a part of my weekly ritual.The bar’s quirky yet inviting atmosphere makes it a great place to catch up with other Bitcoin enthusiasts. Its dimly-lit and orange-tinged front room, lined with brick walls painted black, has a dive-y feel, though the environment still feels tidy and well-manicured.Toward the end of the bar closest to the entrance is the PubKey shrine, replete with Bitcoin memorabilia, literature and tchotchkes. Its centerpiece is a “Buy ₿itcoin” sign, number four of a series of 21 from the “Bitcoin Sign Guy”, Christian Langalis, who was famously captured in a photo holding an identical sign while sitting behind Janet Yellen during her tenure as chair of the Federal Reserve.As you head toward the back of the bar, you pass through a smaller room filled with whimsical bitcoin-themed posters and signs as well as a photo booth and a retro arcade table, before entering the more spacious back room, which Pacchia calls “the attic”, presumably because of the angular shape of the ceiling. This is where the bar holds its Bitcoin meet-ups, and it’s also where you’ll hear from some bigger names in the Bitcoin space who have presented to upwards of 60 people in the room.I recently attended an event at the bar in which Bitcoin evangelists Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert provided an overview of what they described as the Bitcoin-fueled “Renaissance 2.0” happening in El Salvador and another in which James Seyffart, Bloomberg ETF analyst, demystified the mechanics of the new spot bitcoin ETFs.January 11, 2024 — L to R: Thomas Pacchia, James Seyffart, Peter McCormack and Drew Armstrong in “the attic” at PubKey. (Frank Corva)It’s rare to catch such notable voices in the Bitcoin space in such an intimate environment.So, what inspired Pacchia to create this type of venue in a city that’s been anything but kind to Bitcoin?“New York is home,” says Pacchia, who grew up in New Jersey but has been based in New York for some time. “I love New York. It’s one of the best cities on the planet, and it’s not perfect — like anywhere else. But there’s a lot of good stuff here.”And maybe he’s biased, but Pacchia simply doesn’t buy it when he hears people say New York’s best days are behind it.“The only thing that’s been declared dead more often than Bitcoin is New York City,” he says.He would know just how often Bitcoin has been counted out over the years, as he’s been in the Bitcoin space for well over a decade.“The first time I read about Bitcoin was in the Wired article in November 2011,” says Pacchia, referring to one of the first major articles published on Bitcoin. “Then, I was very skeptical, but, you know, it was like a mind virus and stuck with [me]. When I reached a certain threshold, I was like, ‘This is the best thing ever.’ That happened in late 2013.”At that point, he decided to pursue a Master’s in Finance — his third graduate degree after JD and LLM degrees.The program brought him to Hong Kong, where he witnessed the importance of one of Bitcoin’s most oft-promised use cases — remittance payments.“In Hong Kong, Sunday is the day off for most domestic helpers,” says Pacchia. “There’s a very bittersweet thing that happens every Sunday where you have lots of women from Indonesia and [the] Philippines [who] would just sort of put out space and party. It was fun and really cool — a lot of karaoke machines and dancing and stuff like that. But in the backdrop was always a Western Union [sign] advertising 20% remittance [fees for payments] back to the Philippines. That was a really galvanizing moment for me.”Upon returning to New York, Pacchia began working in the finance sector for Bitcoin-friendly companies like Fidelity and Digital Asset Holdings. This was around the time that the BitLicense went into effect.“I think a decent [number] of [Bitcoin] builders left [New York] because it was hostile,” says Pacchia.During the years that followed, Bitcoin culture in New York City was mostly kept alive by BitDevs NYC, a community composed predominantly of Bitcoin developers.“The bedrock of Bitcoin in New York is definitely BitDevs,” explains Pacchia. “BitDevs kept the focus on Bitcoin, which was really important, because in 2016 [through] 2018, there was a lot of money flowing into Ethereum. Consensys [hosted] lots of mixers. There was crypto Mondays and Ripple stuff and Cardano stuff, and there was lots of money being thrown around by VCs to have events. It’s easy for people to get distracted by shiny objects, and Bitcoin didn’t really have a shine to it.”During this era, Pacchia hosted an event at the bar called Formerly Crow’s — which was at PubKey’s location before PubKey.“I would [host] ‘Crypto at the Crow’,” Pacchia says. “It would be about 20 or 30 people that had a happy hour here, and [we discussed] almost all Bitcoin stuff. [The meetings] were informal and not necessarily organized.”That was when Pacchia started hosting Bitcoin meetups for the less technically inclined.COVID challenged both groups.“COVID hit [and] a lot of the public-facing influencers went to Austin [or] Nashville,” Pacchia says. “BitDevs wasn’t able to meet. Consistency is key for these meetups, and that shook some people out.”But in the fall of 2022, Pacchia, along with his two partners, Greg Minasian and Andrew Newman, opened PubKey — without a single one of them having much idea of what they were getting into.“None of us had any hospitality background or experience,” Pacchia says.And still they’ve made it work, as the bar attracts a steady stream of seasoned Bitcoin veterans and those new to Bitcoin.Today, he says the old bitcoiner/new bitcoiner split is about 50/50. But the recent ramp up in prices has definitely brought more Bitcoin-curious through the doors.“It really started to pick up in October-November [2023],” says Pacchia. “That’s where we went from 20 people at a meet-up to consistently 40 or so. Now, on Thursdays, we get people across the entire Bitcoin [and] crypto industry [as well as those in] TradFi.”“Being in a Bitcoin environment allows me to meet up with people that are like minded,” says Isaac, a meet-up regular. “If I have a question or I’m interested in something, it gives me an opportunity to brainstorm it with people that are familiar. PubKey has created a very warm environment.”When I asked Pacchia if he thought it might have been easier to do what he’s done with PubKey in a friendlier jurisdiction outside New York), he said:“We want to be beachheads. We want to plant a flag in the sand. Bitcoiners need more playmakers. We need people [who] are just going to do stuff. Stepping up and doing a thing is hard, but it’s worth it — and I think that Bitcoiners [get that].”Edited by Benjamin Schiller."

Mempools are essentially waiting rooms for Bitcoin transactions.\"By default, Bitcoin nodes frequently exclude large and non-standard transactions from Bitcoin’s mempool, even if these transactions adhere to the Bitcoin network’s consensus rules,\" said Marathon. \"As a result, complex Bitcoin transactions are often delayed or unprocessed.

As Marathon can operate as the sole miner in its own mining pool, the company says it's able to customize its pool's settings to accept more \"diverse\" transactions.However, such customization brings the question of censoring user transactions. The topic has been hotly debated recently, as some mining pools have been accused of censoring. Marathon said that transactions submitted through Slipstream will be subject to certain terms of service, which \"prohibit unauthorized copyrighted material and objectionable material.\"Read more: Bitcoin's Anti-Censorship Ethos Surfaces After Mining Pool F2Pool Acknowledges 'Filter'The need for such service exists as other mining pools currently don't offer similar products \"in a standardized, accessible manner,\" the company said in a separate statement.

        "content": "On Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) published a blog repeating debunked claims about bitcoin (BTC). The world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, according to ECB Director General Ulrich Bindseil and advisor Jürgen Schaaf, has failed as a currency and investment. And therefore, it has a fair value of “zero dollars.”In other words: the central bank for the world’s largest trading block cannot recommend bitcoin because it’s going to crash. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Unmute“The latest approval of an ETF doesn’t change the fact that bitcoin is not suitable as means of payment or as an investment,” Bindseil and Schaaf wrote, referencing the fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that went live in the U.S. in January, which have so far largely exceeded analyst predictions.If it seems off that the ECB would comment at all on bitcoin, it’s likely because the authors too feel the Crypto Vibe Shift, and see a potential rally on the horizon following the successful launch of ETFs and the lifting of crypto winter. Bitcoin has more than doubled in price to above $51K in the last six months, according to CoinDesk Indices.“For society, a renewed boom-bust cycle of Bitcoin is a dire perspective. And the collateral damage will be massive,\" they write, adding later “Bitcoin’s price level is not an indicator of its sustainability.\" Yet it is impossible for the authors not to acknowledge the recent gains, even if they predict the “speculative bubble” to someday pop.“The rally in the autumn of 2023 was initiated by the prospect of an imminent turnaround in the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, the halving of the BTC mining rewards in spring [2024] and later the approval of the bitcoin spot ETF by the SEC,\" Bindseil and Schaaf write. It’s an interesting move to reverse the clock to try to explain what “initiated” bitcoin’s rally considering all three of those factors — rate cuts, the halving and ETFs — are still in play.See also: Bitcoin ETFs See Record $2.4B Weekly InflowsStill despite those economic drivers, the authors say that bitcoin “is still not suitable as an investment” because it lacks cash flows, dividends, productive commercial uses or “social benefit” and that interest in the asset is mostly a matter of FOMO and “the effectiveness of the Bitcoin lobby.”Why exactly have Bitcoin boosters been so effective over the years? Why are stablecoins seeing rapid adoption in countries beset by hyperinflation? Why is bitcoin attractive to people in the U.S. and E.U.? These are questions that go unasked, perhaps because over the past decade the euro has lost 99.5% of its value versus bitcoin, according to TradingView data.This isn’t even the first time the ECB has predicted bitcoin’s demise. In 2022, Bindseil and Schaaf wrote that a move from $17,000 to $20,000 in the weeks after the collapse of FTX was a “dead cat bounce” and “an artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.” While it’s true it took a long time for bitcoin to regain ground, bitcoin now looks set to retest its all-time high around $69,000.Not willing to contemplate at all why people are interested in cryptocurrencies (for instance, not once were the words inflation, savings or high fees brought up), Bindseil and Schaaf further argue that any rise could likely be explained by “price manipulation” and fraud. They cite a Forbes study from 2022 that found 51% of reported bitcoin exchange volumes were likely faked, a study I might add that does not make Bindseil and Schaaf's mistake of conflating price with volumes.But the authors cannot help themselves as seeing bitcoin as a criminal enterprise — drawing connections between disparate events to suggest that misuse somewhere means abuse everywhere. At one point they discuss how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Twitter/X account was hacked to post fake news about bitcoin ETFs, for instance. (This may just be me, but I think that reflects more poorly on the SEC than on the Bitcoin network.)It is to the point that the ECB is either willfully lying or genuinely misleading itself about the criminal use of bitcoin, a long running claim that has been debunked time and again. Without citing a source, the authors write “Despite the market downturn, the volume of illicit transactions has continued to rise.” All available evidence, including yearly crime reports from Chainalysis, suggest that crypto crime declines in market downturns.See also: Crypto Money Laundering Dropped 30% Last Year: ChainalysisFurther, the claim that bitcoin “remains the top choice for money laundering in the digital world” is patently false. Perhaps it’s unfair to compare bitcoin to the world's reserve currency, the U.S. dollar, which dominates in global and online crime, but why again was the 500 euro note banned?Later, the authors directly contradict themselves when discussing the precise reason why bitcoin is falling out of favor for criminal use: because it is run on an immutable, fully public and transparent ledger. “Therefore, Bitcoin has been a cursed tool for anonymity, facilitating illicit activities and leading to legal action against offenders by the tracing of transactions,” they write.Perhaps the only thing the authors got right is when they said the “decentralised nature of Bitcoin presents challenges for authorities, sometimes leading to unnecessary regulatory fatalism.” True, Bitcoin exists for a reason — whether they want to examine that or not — but it doesn’t mean that the use of this network cannot be appropriately regulated.The ECB would be better off doing just that, rather than predicting Bitcoin’s death for the thousandth time."

Meanwhile, the ECB has been heads down on building and promoting a digital euro – a trusty central bank-issued currency that could offer a secure alternative to rogue private crypto.Apart from stating bitcoin’s usual vices, such as high volatility, cost, slow transactions, and high energy use in mining, the central bankers detailed three factors fuelling the current rally.“The ongoing manipulation of the ‘price’ in an unregulated market without oversight and without fair value, the growing demand for the ‘currency of crime,’ and shortcomings in the authorities’ judgments and measures” will drive the price in the short term, but “there is no fair value from which serious forecasts can be derived,” Bindseil and Schaaf wrote.Authorities must stay vigilant to protect society when the house of cards eventually collapses, the two warned.“This job has not been done yet,” they said.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

The price has recovered somewhat since, trading at $51,260 at press time, down 1.15% over the past 24 hours and roughly in line with the broad-market CoinDesk20 Index (CD20) performance.Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization, suffered a similar fate, tumbling to $2,900 after earlier crossing above $3,000 for the first time since April 2022.Bitcoin's sell-off mirrored price action from Thursday and Friday when intraday rallies above $52,500 reverted almost immediately. Zooming out a bit, prices have roughly traded in a range of $51,000 to $52,500 for the past week.Continued sideways action ahead?The failed attempt to break above $53,000 could foreshadow further consolidation in the current range, with prices taking a breather after rising over 30% since late January's post-bitcoin ETF correction. This price range represents a crucial resistance area on long-term charts, which capped rallies in the second half of 2021.\"The current price level is an important technical level for BTC, coinciding with both the peak of the September 2021 'El Salvador' rally and the resistance ahead of the December 4 crash of the same year,\" Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, wrote in a Tuesday market update.Analysts at crypto analytics firm Swissblock noted Friday that bitcoin's stalling momentum may foreshadow a deeper pullback and a potential buying opportunity.The $53,000 area is also marked by the previous market cycle top of the weekly Ichimoku Could, a momentum and trend indicator, which posed major resistance for BTC's price in 2016 and 2019, while breakouts in early 2017 and late 2020 cleared the path for new all-time highs, crypto technical analyst CryptoCon noted.According to CryptoCon's chart posted on X, bitcoin's price reverted first at similar levels during the prior two bull markets, followed by a lengthy consolidation period, while breakouts to higher prices happened at later stages in bitcoin's market cycle, after the quadrennial Bitcoin halving event.\"The top of the cloud has twice marked the mid-top, a point of steep rejection and a long sideways period,\" CryptoCon said in the post. \"A break of this point now would be almost an entire year earlier than usual.\"Edited by Stephen Alpher."

The ether-bitcoin ratio has jumped nearly 7% to 0.055. CoinDesk Indices CD20, a measure of the wider crypto market, has rallied 10.7%.ETH's outperformance comes after weeks of trailing bitcoin as traders focused on the debut of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. and the impending quadrennial reward halving, which will cut the per-block BTC payout to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.Read more: How the ‘Halving’ Could Impact BitcoinThe focus could soon shift to the significant drop in ether supply since Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September 2022 in an upgrade dubbed The Merge, Magadini said. That contrasts with Bitcoin's halving, which just slows the cryptocurrency's rate of growth.\"Everyone is talking about the Bitcoin halving in April, but that’s nothing compared to the active 'REDUCTION' in ETH supply already occurring since Sept. 2022,\" Magadini said in a weekly newsletter. \"ETH is the next play here! Low ETH/BTC ratio, actively finding a bid, [with ETH's] fundamental supply picture even better than BTC.\"Since the Merge, 1,047,643 ETH ($3.05 billion) have been issued and 1,407,200 ETH burned, or taken out of circulation, causing a net supply reduction of 359,557 ETH or 0.209% year-on-year, according to data tracking website Ultrasound.money. Bitcoin's supply increased 1.71% in the same period.Ether's supply change since completion of the merge in September 2022. (Ultrasound.money) (Ultrasound.money)The reduction represents a deflationary trend stemming from Ethereum burning a portion of transaction fees paid to validators. The Merge replaced miners with validators, removing a significant chunk of ether supply from the market.Validators stake a minimum of 32 ETH to participate in the governing process and secure the blockchain in return for rewards. The number of ether staked or locked in the network surpassed 30.1 million, or 25% of the total circulating supply, early this month. The Dencun upgrade, due March, is expected to slash transaction costs.In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to greenlight spot ether ETFs in the U.S. later this year. Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark and 21Shares, Grayscale, VanEck, Invesco and Galaxy, and Hashdex, have submitted applications to run one.The SEC approved nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs last month, paving the way for investors to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own and store coins.

Bitcoin's fourth halving is due on April 19.Bitcoin's daily RSI has crossed above 80, a threshold that has historically presaged 60-day gains of over 50%.Bitcoin (BTC) has had a stellar few months, with bulls ignoring a resurgent U.S. dollar and Treasury yields to push the leading cryptocurrency to the highest level since late 2021.While a price pullback looks plausible, the broader uptrend looks set to continue, with prices revisiting and potentially surpassing the record high of $69,000 before Bitcoin Blockchain's fourth mining reward halving due on April 19.Read More: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedThat's the message from 10X Research after studying past data and a technical analysis indicator called the relative strength index (RSI). Let's discuss both in more detail.Pre-halving bullishnessThe theory that bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, bottoms out 12-16 months ahead of halving and chalks out uptrends ahead of and a year after the halving is well known by now.More importantly for traders, the previous three cycles centered around the halving show prices surged by over 30% in eight weeks leading up to the quadrennial event, which reduces the pace of supply expansion by 50%. The halving due on April 19 will halve the per-block reward to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.\"Bitcoin rallies an average of 32% in 60 days ahead of the halving,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, told CoinDesk.At press time, bitcoin changed hands near $52,000. A 32% rally from here, in accordance with the past data, means prices could trade close to the record high of $69,000 on or before the halving day.\"The closer we reach the Bitcoin halving, the higher the probability that bitcoin will rally, as the evidence from the last three halving cycles shows. This time will be no different as the perception within the crypto community is high that the halving is bullish. This perception is undoubtedly flowing into the TradeFi community, which is aggressively buying these Bitcoin ETFs ahead of the halving,\" Thielen added.Strong inflows into the U.S.-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) suggest a bullish mood among traditional investors. These regulated ETFs allow investors to take exposure to the cryptocurrency, bypassing the hassle of storing coins.Monthly RSI points northRSI, developed by J. Welles Wilder, is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements over a set period, usually 14 days, weeks, or months. Readings above 70 indicate a strong upward momentum in prices.A week ago, bitcoin 14-day RSI crossed above 80 for the first time since December. 12 out of 14 such previous RSI signals presaged accelerated uptrends, producing an average gain of 54% in the following 60 days, according to 10X Research.\"As a reference, Bitcoin traded at $48,294 when the last signal was triggered, and if history (avg. return +54% in 60 days) is any guide, then bitcoin could rally to $74,600 based on this signal,\" Thielen noted.Past performance does not guarantee future results, and macroeconomic factors could single-handedly make or break trends.That said, the present macro picture looks supportive of increased risk-taking, thanks to the U.S. running the most stimulative fiscal policy in years. Goldman Sachs has raised its year-end forecast for the S&P 500 by 4% to 5,200, citing expectations for robust global economic growth and a weaker dollar.Edited by Oliver Knight."

Wright's sister Danielle DeMorgan took to the witness stand on Friday to recount a blog post that she wrote that stated when she heard the name Satoshi, a Japanese name, she knew that was Wright. In the blog, DeMorgan recounted the time she saw Wright in the park dressed as a ninja when he was 18 or 19 – a tale she says explains why she connected the dots.

He had a discussion with Wright about digital currency in 2005 and believed Wright was Satoshi because of the encryption software he wrote in the 2000s. Cerian Jones, a patent attorney, was also questioned on Friday and her statement centered around how Wright's patents showed he could have been the creator of bitcoin.Being associated with Wright isn't necessarily a good thing, Jones said, and when asked why by COPA's lawyer Jonathan Hough, she responded because \"he's a very divisive character.\"His first witnesses entered the courtroom on Thursday, and COPA's lawyers at that time called some of their memories \"hazy\" and not reliable. Wright finished his testimony on Wednesday, and COPA lawyers declared that many of his statements were \"lies.\" Earlier in the week, he was also told by COPA's lawyers to stop making \"irrelevant allegations.\"The trial is set to continue next week. On Monday, more Wright witnesses will testify, according to the court schedule. David Bridges and Max Lynam will take to the stand, followed by his factual witness Stefan Matthews.

Besides following bitcoin’s pump, the catalyst for VET’s surge is unclear, though the company announced earlier in the week that \"Account Abstraction\" had gone live, improving interoperability and unlocking programmable smart contract wallets. According to Kenny Hearn, chief investment officer at SwissOne Capital, the chain is a close second to Chainlink (LINK) in the on-chain oracle market. \"VeChain meeting multiple X2Earn projects this past week must've given an extra kick of bullish sentiment to catalyze the move,” he said. Sei Network (SEI) rose almost 50% and ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, advanced 15%.With bitcoin's price rising to just shy of $53,000, MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate owner of the crypto, has seen its holdings climb above $10 billion, amassing a profit of more than $4 billion. According to the company’s most recent investor presentation, at the end of January the company held 190,000 bitcoins purchased for a total of $5.93 billion, or $31,224 per coin. MicroStrategy began acquiring bitcoin in second-quarter 2020, and has bought tokens every quarter since. In December last year, the company was sitting on a profit of nearly $2 billion, a figure that's doubled thanks to bitcon's more than 20% rally since the start of 2024.Coinbase (COIN) shares surged after the U.S.-listed cryptocurrency exchange beat analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, benefiting from soaring crypto prices. The company said it earned $1.04 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $0.02 per share, according to FactSet data. Revenue of $953.8 million exceeded the analyst forecast of $826.1 million. Shares of the crypto exchange rose about 13% in post-market trading on Thursday after adding about 3% during the regular session. COIN shares had fallen about 4% this year, even as the price of bitcoin (BTC) surged about 23%.Chart of the DayThe chart shows a collection of bid and ask orders in dollar terms within 2% of the mid-price across cryptocurrency exchanges.The ratio of asks to bids rose to the highest in over a year early this week.When the ask is higher than the bid, the price is more likely to move higher than lower.The ask is a price the seller is ready to accept, while the bid is a price the buyer is willing to pay.Source: Kaiko- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsBitcoin's Latest Rally is Different as BTC Rises Alongside U.S. Dollar and Treasury YieldsApple Vision Pros Are Practically Dress Code at This Crypto Hacker HouseU.S. Regulators Do Have Some Control Over Stablecoin Tether: JPMorganEdited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "Bitcoin’s latest move above $50,000 contradicts its record of posting sharp gains, mostly during bouts of weakness in the dollar index and Treasury yields.We could be seeing safe-haven demand for bitcoin from regions like China and Nigeria, one observer said.Bitcoin (BTC) has jumped over 35% to over $52,000 since Jan. 23, consistent with its reputation of chalking double-digit gains in a matter of weeks. The latest move, however, stands out because it has materialized alongside a resurgent U.S. dollar index (DXY) and Treasury yields.The DXY, which gauges the greenback’s exchange rate against major fiat currencies, has gained 3% this year, with the index gaining around 1% since Jan. 23.Historically, bitcoin has been negatively correlated with the U.S. dollar, posting sharp rallies only during bouts of dollar weakness. For instance, the DXY fell 2% to under 90 in February 2021 when bitcoin first rose above $50,000.As a global reserve, the U.S. dollar is outsized in international finance and non-bank borrowings. Thus, a strengthening dollar leads to financial tightening worldwide, disincentivizing investment in risky assets like technology stocks, cryptocurrencies and commodities like gold.Similarly, an uptick in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, or the so-called risk-free rate, usually spurs outflows from other assets. The yield has risen from 4.10% to 4.26% in three weeks, with hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation figure denting the probability of an early Fed rate cut.Bitcoin’s resilience likely stems from strong inflows into the U.S.-based spot exchange-traded funds in the U.S. Nearly a dozen ETFs began trading in the U.S. on Jan. 11 and have since amassed roughly $5 billion in net inflows.“What we started seeing when BTC didn’t drop along with the jump in DXY and U.S. yields was the beginning of strong inflows – there was buying pressure offsetting the usual sell pressure, and that seems to be picking up,” Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told CoinDesk.“We could be seeing more ‘safe-haven’ buying from regions such as China, Nigeria and others - we’re probably also seeing some speculative inflows front-running the growth of the investor base and the halving,” Acheson added.China, the world’s second-largest economy, has been facing deflationary pressures, a property market crisis, and a stock market meltdown. Per Reuters, Chinese citizens have turned to bitcoin amid economic malaise. Similarly, Nigeria’s ongoing currency crisis and rampant inflation may have spurred cryptocurrency demand.Acheson said that bitcoin has always been a safe haven for some and an emerging technology play (or risk asset) for others, explaining the hedging demand for the cryptocurrency. “The ETFs don’t change that, they just act as a channel,” he added.Meanwhile, according to QCP Capital, the CME’s decision to increase the required margin for trading its bitcoin futures may have contributed to the bitcoin rally.“This has recently become an important trigger for volatility. In this case, leveraged players were positioned short, and the new requirement resulted in widespread short covering over a relatively illiquid Lunar New Year weekend. This drove both spot prices and forwards higher. The forward spread trade in BTC is now back to around 11-12% annually,” QCP said on X.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Their latest view – the low probability of a record move above $70,000 by the end of April – might be a surprise.That’s because bitcoin has risen 35% to $52,000 in three weeks, the highest since late 2021, exhibiting a robust bullish momentum fueled by strong inflows into the U.S.-based spot ETFs.The consensus among crypto traders is that bitcoin could see further gains as fiscal policy in the U.S. remains the most stimulative in years, compensating for higher interest rates. Bitcoin blockchain’s supposedly bullish quadrennial mining reward halving is also due in April, and global recession probability has declined to its lowest since December 2021, supporting risk-taking across all corners of the financial market.Options are derivatives that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives someone the right to buy an asset, while a put option confers the right to sell.

        "content": "Over the course of nearly 30 hours of cross-examination, Craig Steven Wright, the Australian man who claims to be Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has been raked through the coals. The self-described computer scientist, economist, cryptographer, patent writer, author, lawyer, pastor, master of martial arts and mathematician (in other words: fabulist) has been accused of misrepresenting facts, told by the judge to stay on topic and silenced by his own lawyers.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteFor years, Wright has been harassing and threatening Bitcoin developers and users, filing libel suits and gag orders, after claiming ownership of the intellectual property behind the world’s first cryptocurrency. And it’s that “chilling effect,” that the nonprofit Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) was trying to shut down when it filed suit in 2021 — the most aggressive attempt yet to settle once and for all that Wright is not what he says he is.Jonathan Hough, COPA’s lead lawyer, argued in his opening statement that over the past eight years, ever since Wright came into the public eye, he has committed fraud on “an industrial scale.” During the cross-examination, which wrapped up Wednesday, Hough accused CSW of forging or manipulating documents related to the development of Bitcoin and misunderstanding the basics of the system Wright supposedly built.See also: Craig Wright Witnesses Face Questions About Their Memories in COPA TrialThat said, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove Wright is wrong. And Wright, who has been described as (largely) calm and articulate in the courtroom, certainly has convinced people in the past (including his benefactor, billionaire online gambling magnate Calvin Ayre). For many onlookers, however, the case has already been made: Wright, by taking the stand, simply discredited himself. There have been too many inconsistencies, too many happenstances and too much misdirection to be believed.The trial is expected to go until mid-March. For now, CoinDesk has collected some of the most bizarre, asinine and head scratching moments from the case so far.The 'unusual features of Dr. Wright’s behavior'The opening statement from Wright’s lawyers, given by Lord Anthony Grabiner, was almost an indictment in itself. Put in the tough position of explaining Wright’s reluctance to show  how he can interact with any of the millions of Bitcoin linked to Satoshi (thus easily proving his right to the Satoshi mantle), Grabiner said it was down to  “philosophical differences.” Apparently Wright’s “unusual” behavior of flip flopping on whether to sign a transaction, as he pledged to do in 2016, would conflict with Wright’s “core belief” in privacy. Putting aside that Wright lives a very public life, Wright has also criticized the pseudonymous aspects of crypto, saying it’s part of the reason Bitcoin has become a hotbed for crime.Computer science 101Wright, who claims to be working towards five PhDs, apparently does not know the very basics of coding. During a cross-examination by Alexander Gunning KC asking about PGP keys and cryptography, Wright was asked about “unsigned integers,” (used essentially to determine whether a string of data will have a + or – prefix), and wasn’t able to. Longtime crypto advocate Michael Parenti noted the unsigned integer function was used over 500 times in the original Bitcoin source code. What was meant to be a routine line of questioning to enter basic facts into the record about the Bitcoin source code may be the single moment remembered for years to come.As @bitnorbert, who has been following the trial, said on X’:“HE COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT AN UNSIGNED INTEGER IS.“If you're not a programmer, perhaps you don't appreciate what a basic thing this is. An average first-semester computer science student should be able to explain this. The judge, with his computer science background, certainly can. This is like having someone who says they're a mathematician not being able to explain what multiplication is.”Weird insecuritiesWright likes to make himself out to be a workaholic. At one point in the trial he said he has written three patents so far that week, during lunchtimes — on Feb. 13 alone he “wrote two papers.” Thankfully, he has given the courtroom a little insight into what drives him to work tirelessly.“I keep being told by other people what I can and cannot do. I keep being told I am useless by others. This is one of the reasons I keep getting all these degrees,” he said on the last day of his cross-examination.If you were thinking that Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in an attempt to better the world, think again. It turns out that he actually had a huge chip on his shoulder and an emptiness inside.Why lie?In 2020, Wright published a blog titled “As an Autistic Savant…” that made the case that he was telling the truth about inventing Bitcoin because he had Aspergers (a diagnosis that was retired from the Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013).“Lying is not something I do easily or well, and my behavior is not a mark of deception but rather normal for autistic individuals. I am brutally honest, but also incredibly precise,” he said.It’d be too much to list every inconsistency brought up in the trial — the main strategy of the COPA legal team has been to force Wright to account for the hundreds of indications of forgery and manipulation found by a forensic evidence expert in emails, documents and computer files submitted into evidence.See also: Craig Wright Cross Examination Ends as COPA Trial Closes for DayBut to take just two striking examples where he wasn’t exactly “precise” with his language, at one point Wright claimed he did not have a Reddit account and has never used the popular message board site. Well, here’s his account.Wright also said he faked Satoshi’s PGP key, perhaps mistakenly.Master manipulatorRelatedly, Wright denies forging or plagiarizing any of the documents submitted into evidence. He has blamed hacks, faulty internet connections and a grand conspiracy of people trying to “frame” him as a liar for some of the inconsistencies brought — like metadata that shows documents pertaining to the creation of Bitcoin were made using Word 2015.See also: Craig Wright Blasts 'Experts' Who 'Cannot Verify Their Work'On the opening day of the case, Judge Mellor acknowledged the allegations of forged documents  and told Wright he “should consider himself extremely lucky” to argue his case, given the circumstances.When asked by Mellor on Wednesday to produce a single document related to early Bitcoin files that doesn’t show signs of tampering, Wright said they would be unavailable. Plus, he argued, it couldn’t possibly be him manipulating the documents, because if it were, he wouldn’t have gotten caught.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."

        "content": "Bitcoin reached a record high in Yen terms early Thursday, leaving behind bitcoin's U.S. dollar-, euro-, British pound- and Australian dollar-denominated prices.Continued money printing by Bank of Japan and resurgent inflation have weakened sentiment around the Japanese yen.Fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, euro, and others are not backed by a hard asset, and their value is subjective and depends entirely on market perceptions at any point. Bitcoin’s (BTC) ongoing rally is telling of current market perceptions, with sentiment being weakest for the yen (JPY) among major fiat currencies.For instance, early Monday, the leading cryptocurrency, often considered digital gold, hit a new record high of 7.9 million yen on Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange bitFLYER. In contrast, the cryptocurrency’s dollar-denominated price stood above $52,000 or 32% short of the record high of $69,000 reached in November 2021, according to data from the charting platform TradingView.The price differential reflects relative stress on the Japanese yen, stemming from the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) continued liquidity easing, resurgent inflation and signs of economic weakness. The Japanese economy slipped into an economic recession at the end of the last year, slipping to fourth place behind Germany.While the Federal Reserve and other central banks raised interest rates aggressively in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation, the BOJ kept interest rates at zero and continued printing tons of fiat money.Japan’s core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy component from the consumer price index, climbed 3.1% in 2023, marking its biggest gain since 1982. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies and catalyzes investments into alternative assets with store-of-value appeals like bitcoin and gold.The yen depreciated 13% and 7.5% against the dollar and is down another 6.4% this year. Bitcoin could continue to trade at a premium in the Japanese yen terms unless the Bank of Japan accelerates the planned exit from the ultra-easy monetary policy, making it relatively attractive to hold the yen over other assets.Note that Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore are known to have better legal clarity regarding digital assets trading than other developed markets. That, coupled with persistent volatility in fiat currencies, could foster the growth of alternative assets like cryptocurrencies in these regions.BTC trades at record highs against the Japanese yen.

        "content": "The new entrants coming into Bitcoin via the recently launched ETF and prices bounce back up towards $50,000, it’s a good time to dig a bit into the Bitcoin halving, as we’re expected to go into another halving event in mid-April.The Bitcoin halving cycle refers to the recurring event that reduces the blockchain rewards paid in bitcoin and given to miners for validating transactions and creating new blocks on the blockchain. This reduction occurs approximately every four years, specifically when the number of total blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain threshold, currently set at 210,000 blocks.You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.The halving event aims to maintain the scarcity of Bitcoin by gradually decreasing the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation. Ultimately, this process will result in a total of 21 million Bitcoins being mined, with no more Bitcoins being generated after the final halving event.Read more: What Is the Bitcoin Halving?The general consensus is that Bitcoin halving events are positive for the price of Bitcoin, and historically they have been. The event often generates optimism among crypto investors, leading to positive price action afterward. This positive price movement can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the reduction in the supply issuance rate emphasizes Bitcoin's scarcity, which can drive up demand and consequently increase its price.Additionally, the halving event brings attention to the crypto space, attracting new investors and contributing to increased trading activity. However, it's important to note that while the halving historically has led to price increases, the magnitude of these increases may diminish with each subsequent halvings.To look more closely into the effects Bitcoin halving periods have had on distribution of returns, we looked back from July 2010 to February 2024 utilizing the CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin XBX Price Index, and compare the distribution of weekly returns of each halving period as bitcoin increased in value from 0.1 to recent levels of 50k USD per BTC.(Source: CoinDesk Indices, Investing.com)July 2010 - October 2014 period utilizes BTCUSD pricing from Investing.com; Return outliers of 0.5% and 99.5% were removed for sake of distribution illustrative purposes.(Source: CoinDesk Indices, Investing.com)From the overlay of these distributions, and comparison of annual return and volatility, we can see that as the distribution of returns has narrowed as the bitcoin market has matured from a crypto enthusiast hobby to a real asset with institutional interest. This evolution can also be seen in the decrease in both returns and volatility over each subsequent halving, while Return per Volatility has held more constant after the first halving. This evolution suggests that investors should not expect similar performance gains in Bitcoin that were experienced when the market was in its early stages prior to 2012.One area of the market that is directly affected by the halving event is the Bitcoin miners, via an immediate halving of block rewards for new blocks. This reduction in mining rewards can impact miners' revenue and profitability, as miners could face increased competition and higher operational costs, potentially leading to consolidation within the mining sector. Smaller miners may struggle to remain profitable, while larger players with greater resources, cheaper sources of electricity and economies of scale may dominate the industry.Looking beyond the halving events, the future of Bitcoin mining will eventually transition to relying solely on transaction fees once all 21 million Bitcoins have been mined. This shift will occur approximately 31 years after Bitcoin's inception. Miners will need to adapt to this change towards relying solely on transaction fees, although this will be a gradual change from each halving.Innovations in the crypto space, such as additional protocols and tokens that coexist alongside Bitcoin (e.g. Ordinals), may provide opportunities for miners to diversify and optimize their mining operations to maintain revenue beyond Bitcoin block rewards.We’ve come a long way in the evolution of Bitcoin from a cypherpunk and cryptography enthusiast hobby to a digitally-scarce store of value with its own spot ETFs and regulated derivative markets. That said, through market cycles, and increases in market capitalization, the volatility of the asset has decreased. So we should taper our expectations when analyzing historical halving cycles, as Bitcoin holders today are very different from holders in 2010.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."

When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on March 10, 2023, fears of contagion sent stocks down by over -1% the next trading day, but bitcoin rose by 20%. This “safe haven” price response was a new phenomenon for bitcoin, and time will tell if it persists. But bitcoin is outperforming all other asset classes over the last 1, 3, 5, and 10 years, periods that include many stresses.Research from Galaxy shows that a 1% allocation to bitcoin in a 55% S&P 500 / 35% Bloomberg U.S. Agg / 10% Bloomberg Commodity portfolio over 5 years from August 2018 - August 2023 would have resulted in higher returns and better risk adjusted returns, with virtually no impact on volatility or max drawdown:Last week, Fidelity added bitcoin to its diversified ETF portfolios in Canada, with a 1% allocation for the Conservative ETF and a 3% allocation for the Growth ETF. With many bitcoin ETFs now available in the US, such as the low cost Franklin Templeton EZBC or iShares IBIT, it is easy for US investors to follow suit.Little by little, your portfolio may gain a lot.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."

        "content": "OP_CAT has the goal of restoring functionality that was available in early versions of the network software but was removed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010.The BIP's developers see OP_CAT as a simple upgrade to introduce greater functionality for the building of L2s, decentralized exchanges or even file hosting.Such concepts however often prove contentious among some members of the Bitcoin community.As Bitcoin developers experiment with features and upgrades that increasingly resemble the vibrant activity on alternative blockchains like Ethereum, some of programmers are pushing for a revival of a piece of code that existed on the network in its early days.A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for a new version of the \"OP_CAT\" code, introduced in October, aims to restore functionality that was available in early versions of the blockchain's software but was removed by its elusive and likely pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2010.The \"cat\" in the proposed operational code is short for \"concatenate\" – since technically the function was used to join two elements in a script.Nakamoto was concerned that OP_CAT exposed the network to security concerns, such as the risk of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if it were used in conjunction with other opcodes to create very large stack elements. Another concern was the potential for \"exponential\" memory requirements.The developers behind the new proposal, BastionZero co-founder Ethan Heilman and Botanix Labs lead software engineer Armin Sabouri, describe their refreshed version of OP_CAT as a simple piece of coding – just a dozen or so lines. They say it could provide the general-purpose functionality that's been missing from Bitcoin since its very early days, and that's been a key driver of growth on Ethereum, the second-biggest blockchain. If launched, so-called layer-2 networks might be easier to build atop Bitcoin, along with other innovations like decentralized exchanges or file hosting.This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.The developers argue that technological advances since 2010 and other changes to the Bitcoin code have already addressed many of the risks that worried Nakamoto.\"Having worked with Bitcoin for a really long time and having built a number of protocols on top of it, one of the big problems I kept running into is that variables in the programmability of the network can't really be combined,\" Heilman told CoinDesk in an interview.\"My biggest use case for CAT is introducing protocols that have the ability to post something on the layer 1 and have another transaction reference it, showing that one element proves another element and so on,\" Sabouri explained.Other camps/devs believe Bitcoin is far from ready to ossify ...Such functionality could provide smart contract-like features and trustless bridges to layer 2s, he said.It would also enhance the building of vaults – a type of Bitcoin smart contract or “covenant” that puts constraints on how a bitcoin can be spent. These systems can help deter hackers or other malicious parties from attacking decentralized apps.\"It's pretty common in second-layer designs to have to combine things in order to sign or hash them, Merkle trees being a really good example,\" Sabouri said. \"The fact that you cannot do that in the scripting language of Bitcoin is a pretty big shortcoming.\"Screenshot of the proposed code for reviving OP_CAT on Bitcoin. (GitHub)Philosophical conflictsThe proposal could prove contentious among some members of the Bitcoin community who believe adding functionality to the network is at odds with the blockchain's original ethos of providing a store of value and a peer-to-peer payments network.The Ordinals protocol, for example, was a notable development for essentially bringing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to Bitcoin for the first time, by allowing users to \"inscribe\" data on chain. However, the congestion that the inscriptions caused, and the premium they added to fees, drew ire from some Bitcoin purists.Luke Dashjr, an influential Bitcoin developer who has mounted campaigns to fight what he terms as \"spam\" transactions on the 15-year-old blockchain, told CoinDesk in a direct message that he is \"not familiar enough with the use cases for OP_CAT to comment on it specifically right now.\"\"Building on Bitcoin is fine. Attacking Bitcoin (eg, \"ordinals\") is not,\" Dashjr wrote.\"There is the camp that believes Bitcoin should entirely ossify and not change much because its such a vital piece to this core new money system,\" André Neves, co-founder and chief technology officer of Bitcoin payments company Zebedee, told CoinDesk via email. \"Other camps/devs believe Bitcoin is far from ready to ossify, as there's a lot more to be added/fixed/improved.\"\"There are people who want Bitcoin to work forever just how it is working now,\" Heilman said. \"I don't think they are wrong; it's just a question of the philosophy and the direction that the greater community wants to go in.\"OP_CAT might indirectly help to relieve network congestion, according to the authors.\"We need to be looking at how we can get Ordinals onto a second layer, so it's on a completely different network which has a Bitcoin peg but does not consume any on-chain footprint,\" Sabouri said. \"Things like CAT enable more layer 2s, so really it's a toolbox to enable the building of those trust-minimized pegs onto different off-chain protocols.\"Holding patternAt this point, OP_CAT is still in a holding pattern, up for discussion but without much apparent movement. It was assigned a BINANA (Bitcoin Inquisition Numbers And Names) number of BIN-2024-0001, which would allow it to be added onto the Signet test network, but it still has not been assigned a \"BIP\" number as a formal Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.Theoretically, the proposal would be subject to extensive public reviews and meetings where other developers will raise issues with the code, discuss improvements and so on.Heilman said this will commence in early March with hopes of it being approved by the end of the month.But major proposals like this can be tough to push through on Bitcoin – seen as perhaps the most leaderless and decentralized blockchain, often relying on volunteers to maintain the code repository – unless there is a groundswell of community support that leads to overall consensus about an update.\"It is really hard to predict how long from this point it will take for CAT to be activated into Bitcoin,\" he added. \"It is possible that the CAT code will be merged into Bitcoin Core in April and the soft-fork activation process could begin soon after. It is also possible that it takes a year or more or that the community decides they don't want CAT at all.\"Dashjr, for his part, said he doubts OP_CAT will get incorporated \"in the near future.\" However, another proposal, known as CTV, for \"OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY,\" is likely closer to reality. That function would introduce new scripting logic for how a transaction can spend specific coins.Bob Bodily, CEO of Bioniq, an Ordinals marketplace, said that \"even though CTV is the technically better proposal, CAT has way more positive mindshare in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and almost everyone wants it, regardless of the specific Bitcoin camp you are part of.\"Litmus TestIndeed, the OP_CAT proposal's fate might be seen as a litmus test for where the community sees Bitcoin going: Will it become a more general-purpose, programmable blockchain or preserved strictly as a peer-to-peer payments system and settlement layer for financial transactions?\"We all know what the problems with Bitcoin are to do with scalability and so on, and we've got to solve them at some point, or otherwise it won't work for mass adoption,\" Sabouri said. \"There's going to be much bigger, more complicated upgrades, but OP_CAT's such a simple and easy one that I think will set the template for how future upgrades should go.\"If OP_CAT isn't adopted, other proposals for added functionality, such as \"covenants\" might do the trick, according to Neves, the Zebedee co-founder.OP_CAT was recently honored by Bitcoin Ordinals project Taproot Wizards with a NFT-like collection of digital cats. Despite multiple technical difficulties and delays in the minting process, the 3,000 collectibles priced at 0.1 BTC ($4,300) each sold out, bringing in total revenue of nearly $13 million. They're now changing hands on the secondary marketplace Magic Eden for nearly 0.3 BTC. Less than 24 hours later, buyers were already flipping them for more than twice the original price.The episode might offer a market indicator of how much pent-up demand there is for Ethereum-style functionality on Bitcoin, still the largest blockchain by far, with a market capitalization of $929 billion.\"Taproot Wizards approached us after we put out the proposal, asking us how they could help,\" Sabouri said. \"They wanted to know what resources they could provide to see OP_CAT go through as the next software, which they're really determined to see happen.\"One might say it's a ball of yarn to be unraveled.Edited by Bradley Keoun."

The open interest tally has increased 22% this year, nearing the record $24 billion seen in mid-November 2021 when bitcoin traded above $65,000.The renewed interest in leveraged products like futures alongside a price rise represents an influx of new money on the bullish side and confirms the uptrend. Bitcoin has rallied 28% in just over three weeks, mainly due to strong inflows into the recently launched spot ETFs in the U.S.Leverage, however, magnifies both profits and losses. Hence, a notable rise in futures open interest is often viewed as a harbinger of price volatility.That said, the overall leverage in the market remains low, suggesting a low probability of sudden long (buy positions) liquidations leading to a price crash. Liquidation refers to the forced closure of bullish long or bearish short positions by exchanges on account of a margin shortage. Mass liquidations are known to inject bullish/bearish volatility into the market.Bitcoin's estimated leverage ratio has recently ticked slightly higher from 0.18 to 0.20, but it is nowhere near the levels seen in August last year, data from CryptoQuant show.Besides, at 430,500, futures open interest in BTC terms remains well below the peak of 660,000 reached in October 2022, per CoinGlass.\"The leverage build-up is still relatively low, judging by the BTC futures open interest in BTC terms (to remove the price effect) – it’s climbing fast, but it’s not at frothy levels yet,\" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto is Macro Now newsletter said in Tuesday's edition.The overall degree of leverage in the market remains low.

The dip, however, was shortlived, with prices leveling off at around $49,500 as the Asian business day began, according to CoinDesk Indicies data. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which gauges the performance of top digital assets, has declined 0.73% in the past 24 hours.\"While we saw a small pullback in bitcoin on the back of the news, in general, risk assets seem to be acting as if a March rate cut was still on the table, even though the vast majority of market participants don’t expect this,\" Oliver Rust, head of product at independent economic data provider Truflation said in an email interview.A Polymarket contract gives a 59% chance that bitcoin will hit an all-time high in 2024, while another gives a 66% chance that BTC will hit an all-time high before ETH.\"Until we see a softening in the economic data, rate cuts are likely to be off the table till May or June,\" Rust continued. \"But perhaps markets have simply accepted the fact that higher-for-longer interest rates are here to stay and have learned to live with this new reality now.\"Edited by Omkar Godbole."

In those two years, the analysis found 2,311 reported uses of crypto in such crimes, amounting to more than $412 million.\"Victims of these crimes are placed into forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude, peonage, and/or forced to engage in commercial sex acts,\" the report said. And the use of crypto was on a sharp rise, with 1,975 reports in 2021 eclipsing the 336 in 2020.\"Human traffickers and perpetrators of related crimes despicably exploit adults and children for financial gain,\" said FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki, in a statement. Financial firms flagging these cases \"ultimately helps law enforcement protect and save innocent lives.\"But the most recent data examined was from December 2021 – more than two years ago. That period pre-dated the crypto winter and the subsequent recovery in recent months.A majority of the cases evaluated in this report involved the exchange of crypto for \"child sexual abuse material\" – typically, \"CSAM\" involves explicit photos and videos of children – generally over darknet marketplaces, with the use of crypto kiosks (commonly known as bitcoin ATMs) or with transactions run through mixers, FinCEN noted.The use of crypto and the common methods of transaction have undergone some changes since that period, and crypto data firm Chainalysis noted \"the scale and severity of CSAM activity peaked in 2021,\" according to a review published last month.FinCEN's report suggested that some of the increase over the two-year span could have been spurred by \"raised awareness and vigilance\" from financial institutions informed of criminal use of cryptocurrencies.Read More: U.S. Senators Float Bill Requiring Congressional Watchdog to Study Crypto's Role in Trafficking"

I loathe it,\" Wright continued his passionate tirade until presiding Judge James Mellor intervened and asked the \"lady in the back row,\" who was \"nodding and shaking her head,\" to \"just keep still\" or risk removal.Things got tense as the Australian computer scientist faced his sixth day on the witness stand while counsel for the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) probed documents and other material critical to Wright’s defense of being Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin.On Tuesday, he was once again questioned about a public blog post he’d purportedly signed cryptographically to prove he was Satoshi that experts had since declared a hoax. One question was whether the \"signing sessions\" might be invalid because the keys Wright used could be obtained by someone other than Satoshi. (\"Not at all,\" Wright replied)He insisted that \"identity\" – say, that he’s Satoshi – cannot be proven by \"possession\" of the keys. \"You don't prove by having identity through possession of something. You prove by knowledge. Who you are. What you create,\" Wright said.When asked by COPA counsel Jonathan Hough to agree that producing \"a signed message\" as planned to prove he was Satoshi would not have posed a security risk of the private keys in question being figured out by others, Wright said: \"The security risk is the security of my work, undermining the whole value of everything I've created. Not that the key will be taken.\"The cross-examination continued for another full day, with Mellor intervening several times, including warning Wright that if he doesn’t answer a question, he’s going to \"assume\" he has no answer for it.COPA tried to point out irregularities in Wright’s evidence and testimony provided in previous cases. In one instance, Wright changed his story on whether or not Dave Kleimann (someone Wright himself previously said was key to the invention of bitcoin – but disputed that claim Monday) was a trustee at Wright’s company Tulip Trading.Wright will testify again on Wednesday, after which an expert witness for the defense may take the stand. The trial will continue for a few weeks more.Edited by Nikhilesh De."

Market participants now see only a 34% chance of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in May, down from 52% a day ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.The lower chance of imminent rate cuts weighed on traditional markets as well. The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield advanced 12 basis points, while the S&P 500 equity gauge and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined as much as 2%.\"This is not the inflation report that the Federal Reserve wanted to see and markets have responded accordingly,\" Craig Erlam, senior analyst at online brokerage platform OANDA, said in a Tuesday note.He pointed out that traders now price in only three rate cuts (75 basis point) for 2024, a significant drop from 175 basis points at some point last month, but suggests that fears about inflation might have swung overly pessimistic.\"While markets appeared to be positioned too optimistically last month, I wonder whether the pendulum has now swung too far in the other direction,\" Erlam said. \"We have still seen substantial progress on inflation and I expect we'll see more over the coming months.\"Erlam noted that the \"nasty\" inflation reading came at an unfortunate time for bitcoin and \"rug-pulled\" its rally just when it broke above the $50,000 level on Monday for the first time since December 2021.\"While damaging in the short run, I don't think it will dampen the mood in the crypto space too much,\" he added.UPDATE (Feb. 13, 19:33 UTC): Updates price action.

SOL jumped 8%, while ether (ETH) rose 6.6% as bitcoin saw buying pressure after the New York market opened on Monday. Ordinals (ORDI), the project allowing the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin, jumped 15% on Tuesday while Avalanche’s AVAX climbed 6%. Growth in major and alternative tokens has seemingly tracked the rise of bitcoin, which touched levels not seen since late 2021. Bitcoin’s rally has been attributed mainly to ETF approvals, but some analysts also point to the record run in U.S. equities as another source for the added demand. LMAX Digital said in a morning note: \"While we wouldn’t rule this out, correlations between bitcoin and traditional assets have been less relevant in recent months.\" LMAX said its focus is now on a retest of the record high from 2021, \"Monday’s push through the January high and above $50k has set the stage for this next big run to the topside.\"Franklin Templeton has applied for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows. The asset manager joins BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark and 21Shares, Grayscale, VanEck, Invesco and Galaxy, and Hashdex, who have all submitted applications in recent months. The filing comes roughly four weeks after Franklin, among nine other issuers, launched a spot bitcoin ETF. Asset management giant BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) have seen the most demand. Franklin has had a less successful start, with only roughly $70 million in inflows since its introduction.Crypto traders are snapping cheap, out-of-the-money (OTM) bitcoin calls at levels around the cryptocurrency’s lifetime high of $69,000.

An overbought reading is often taken as a signal of an impending bearish trend reversal, although it only means the market has rallied a little too fast in a short period and may take a breather.“\"Bitcoin posted its seventh consecutive day of gains, but the strengthening slowed over the weekend. It also coincided with a move above 70 on the RSI on the daily timeframes, which could increase players’ appetite for short-term profit-taking. Caution is also building as we approach the January peak,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior analyst at FxPro, said in an email Monday.Besides, a looming concern is that failed crypto lender Genesis’ forced sale of $1.6 billion in bitcoin, ether and ethereum classics could drive prices lower.

        "content": "To answer the question: No, President Joseph Biden is not suddenly a backer of Bitcoin. But the octogenarian politician’s social media team is appropriating the imagery of hardcore Bitcoiners, after posting an image of the U.S. president with laser eyes on Twitter/X.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteThe picture of Dear Old Joe is apparently a reference to “Dark Brandon,” a meme that Democratic campaigners are trying to force. As Mashable reports:“In response to the Chiefs beating the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, the president posted the eerie portrait that liberals have reinterpreted and used since 2022 to depict Biden as a superhero …“The genesis of the Dark Brandon meme is peak internet, which really just means its story is murky and hard to trace. As Vox explained in 2023, the meme seemingly originated at a NASCAR Xfinity Series race in October 2021, when NBC reporter Kelli Stavast determined crowd chants of \"F**k Joe Biden!\" as \"Let’s go Brandon!\" during a live interview with winning driver Brandon Brown.”Biden, eyes inflamed, arms crossed and teeth twinkling, confused the world especially considering that bitcoin has been on a tear. The cryptocurrency is now trading at its highest level since December 2021.See also: Bitcoin Pushes Through $50K for First Time Since Late 2021But orange-pilled, he is not. According to Mashable, the meme is a response to a right-wing conspiracy theory that the Biden administration would rig the Super Bowl to secure support from billionaire superstar country singer Taylor Swift. If that doesn’t make sense, congrats; you haven’t rotted your brain by spending all your free time online.To quickly unpack it: Swift, who campaigned for Biden in 2020, recently started dating Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce, who, during the coronavirus pandemic, did public outreach trying to convince his fans to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This apparently puts them both in the pocket of Big Blue.Swift is already riding the wave of newfound fame after her blockbuster Eras tour, which is widely cited as the highest-grossing concert series of all time. The only thing that could boost her reputation, and therefore help her brainwash her fans into voting for Biden, would be if her boyfriend was part of the winning team of the highest-watched, live televised event of the year.Indeed, the Chiefs pulled ahead literally in the final seconds of overtime, becoming the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowl games since Tom Brady led the New England Patriots two decades ago.\"Just like we drew it up,\" Dark Biden posted on social media, making light of the bizarro-land conspiracy.To be fair to Bitcoiners who got over excited by another politician posting laser eyes, two years after the joke stopped being relevant, Biden’s social media team’s “meme” wasn’t exactly easy to parse. But if there was any group that should have been in-the-know, it should have been crypto fanatics.After all, one of the biggest proponents of the idea that Swift and Kelce are in a sham relationship only for Biden’s benefit was Vivek Ramaswamy, who was the Crypto Candidate before dropping out of the race. He wrote last month on X: \"I wonder if there’s a major presidential endorsement coming from an artificially culturally propped-up couple this fall.\"Almost all the top posts to Biden’s “meme” (can it be a meme if only democratic insiders can pick up on it?) were crypto/financial influencers asking “What is happening” or “Thought this was Joe Biden (Parody) at first.” How quickly we forget. Biden’s account has posted Dark Brandon a few times, and everytime the same people respond the same way — each time their dopamine receptors seem a little more fried.You do have to wonder why Biden’s social media team is copying crypto’s aesthetics. Is he trying to reconnect with a potentially large voter base after previously calling upon the whole of government to bring crypto in line? Is he trying to bait a “single-issue” voter base who is likely not going to back him anyway? Is he trying to woo Sen. Lummis?See also: Why the Politics of Crypto Feels Different This TimeSocial media is a powerful force for connecting to constituents, though it can backfire. It's notable that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis essentially based his failed presidential campaign around internet-tinged culture war issues, even choosing to announce his bid on a Twitter/X live voice chat alongside super-poster Elon Musk.Choosing what to post in electoral politics is often a question of choosing how to post, whether you're willing to debase yourself by trying to seem \"with it\" or sticking to more promotional language. To some extent, Dark Brandon's laser eyes shows how culture is created online, often as a bottom-up phenomenon of people who share interests (like the idea that bitcoin could hit $100K if everyone believes hard enough).It seems like an unlikely coincidence given the prominence of the “laser eyes” meme, which has been sported by elected officials as well as corporations like Franklin Templeton to signal their support of Bitcoin. But nothing seems out of the question these days when it comes to contemporary U.S. politics."

Do you understand?” Mellor said, to which Wright replied: “I do.”Since last week, COPA has been trying to poke holes in material – called “primary reliance documents” – that Wright has submitted to the court as evidence that proves he invented the popular cryptocurrency.Wright continued to blame a host of reasons and people for inconsistencies pointed out by Hough. Similarities between a dissertation by Wright and a paper authored by Bird & Bird alum Hilary Pearson were blamed on an attribution error made by third-party editors. Wright also sought to blame his ex-wife Lynn Wright’s testimony in a previous case – that she didn’t recall him ever mentioning Bitcoin – on her battle with breast cancer.Read more: Craig Wright Denies Forging Evidence He’s Satoshi on Day 2 of COPA TrialAlthough he had previously testified in another case that he’d typed an email to the father of Dave Kleimann saying “Dave” and Wright were two of the “three key people behind bitcoin,” the computer scientist went back on his story Monday, saying he had someone under his employment type and send the email to make Kleimann’s father “feel proud” of his son. (He also said during the same exchange on Monday that he had typed the sentence but not the email itself.)“The versions just keep changing, don't they?” Hough asked during that exchange, to which Wright replied: “No.”Wright also insists he didn’t think much of Bitcoin at the time of its creation in 2009 – which he calls his invention.“I thought it might get me either a partnership or a professorship with tenure. And that was about the extent of what I thought of my invention,” he said.Wright’s cross-examination will continue at least through Wednesday, and the court may also consider a new “box” of evidence he said his wife has just discovered.Edited by Nikhilesh De."

On Feb. 8, Grayscale shed just 1,850 bitcoin, while the other nine ETFs added nearly 11,000 tokens to their funds. Then on Feb. 9, Grayscale lost 2,252 coins, while the other nine ETFs added more than 13,000. For perspective, just 900 newly mined bitcoin hit the market each day (soon to decline to 450 per day when the Bitcoin halving occurs in April).Crypto winter endsThe price of bitcoin peaked at about $69,000 in November 2021; 2022 was a disaster amid the implosion of the Terra ecosystem and the disintegration of crypto exchange FTX and its wunderkind founder Sam Bankman-Fried in November 2022, along with a number of other high-profile crypto industry blowups.Bitcoin closed 2022 at just above $16,000, down about 75% from its all-time high. Many other crypto tokens suffered even larger routs. Alongside the price drops and big-name collapses, layoffs and shop closings were common throughout the industry – a trend that continued throughout 2023.While 2023 will be remembered as a major bull market period for crypto, the price action for bitcoin was rather lame throughout much of the year. On Oct. 1, bitcoin sat at just $27,000, ahead more than 65% for 2023, but a relatively small recovery considering how high bitcoin had been.The year's final quarter, though, was characterized by growing confidence the SEC – after years of delays and outright denials of any and all attempts by asset managers to launch a spot bitcoin ETF – was finally going to green light the vehicles in early 2024. The price of bitcoin rose nearly 60% in the 2023's final three months to close the year above $42,000.Edited by Nick Baker."

The $50,000 level posed resistance as sellers stepped in on exchanges to take profits, stalling the uptrend.At press time, BTC was changing hands slightly above $50,000, up nearly 4% over the past 24 hours. It outperformed the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index's (CD20) 3% advance. The index recently was hovering at 1,871, just below its intraday all-time high of 1,875 on January 11.Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto, led gains among the CD20 index constituents, surpassing $2,600 and up 5.5% as asset manager Franklin Templeton joined the race for a spot-based ETH ETF Monday. Last week, institutional crypto exchange FalconX’s head of revenue Austin Reid noted \"heavy rotation\" into ETH among market participants in anticipation to spot ETH ETF decision due later this year.Native tokens of Ethereum layer 2 networks Immutable X (IMX), Optimism (OP) and liquid staking platform Lido's token (LDO) benefitted from ETH's rise, rallying 12%, 9% and 7%, respectively.Bitcoin targets $52,000Bitcoin's price action was supported by last week's strong inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs, attracting over $1.1 billion net fresh funds amid slowing outflows from incumbent funds such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and ProShares' futures-based ETF (BITO), asset management firm CoinShares reported Monday. However, potential selling pressure from Genesis, a crypto lender under bankruptcy protection, liquidating its $1.6 billion worth of GBTC holdings could weigh on ETF net inflows and prices in the next months, the report added.Macro analyst Noelle Acheson said that bitcoin is currently benefiting from increased accumulation mainly driven by expectations of capital injection in China to stem its stock market rout and \"inevitable\" currency depreciation even in developed countries in the future.\"Given the lack of any clear catalyst to explain the BTC move over the past few days, what we are probably seeing is a pick-up in accumulation for the aforementioned reasons as well as the continued spread of Bitcoin awareness as the ETF marketing machines do their thing,\" Acheson said.Given BTC's decisive breakout above $48,000, 10x Research's Markus Thielen said in a Monday report that bitcoin could run towards $52,000 in one go, a price target he previously set for mid-March.\"On Saturday, we received a fresh buy signal,\" Thielen wrote, adding that when similar price setups occurred since May 2020, BTC rallied by +8% on average in two weeks.\"This increases the probability that Bitcoin will go in one big rally to our 52,000 target, and the momentum continues to build upon the bullish side,\" Thielen wrote.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

As stated in October's initial $1 billion fraud lawsuit against DCG, its defunct lending platform Genesis and Gemini Trust Co., the companies are accused of misleading investors and assuring them of the safety of their money even as the companies' managements were aware that doom fast approached them. The fraud case focused at first on the Gemini Earn investment program that Genesis and Gemini ran together, but after the lawsuit, James' office said many more investors raised complaints of being swindled by Genesis more directly.Chart of the DayThe chart shows the ratio between Deribit's ether and bitcoin DVOL indices.

        "content": "Bitcoin could see a steady price increase after its halving event on lower selling pressure and new interest in native Bitcoin-based applications.Ordinals have revitalized Bitcoin on-chain activity and bolstered fundamentals while buying demand from spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are likely to support higher prices in the future.Bitcoin’s (BTC) technical fundamentals and use cases have significantly increased in the past year and likely made the asset “stronger” ahead of its historically bullish halving event compared to previous years, crypto asset management Grayscale said in a research note last week.“Despite miner revenue challenges in the short term, fundamental on-chain activity and positive market structure updates make this halving different on a fundamental level,” researcher Michael Zhao said. “While it has long been heralded as digital gold, recent developments suggest that bitcoin is evolving into something even more significant.”Halving is part of the Bitcoin network’s code to reduce inflationary pressure on the cryptocurrency and will cut the rewards in half for successfully mining a bitcoin block. This makes obtaining or mining new bitcoin much harder – and has historically preceded bull runs.Ordinals Bump FundamentalsZhao stated that the advent of ordinal inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens had revitalized on-chain activity on Bitcoin, generating upwards of $200 million in transaction fees for miners as of February 2024.“This trend is expected to persist, bolstered by renewed developer interest and ongoing innovations on the Bitcoin blockchain,” he said.Bitcoin fees generated from Ordinals. (Grayscale)The BRC-20 standard (BRC stands for Bitcoin Request for Comment) was introduced in April to allow users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network for the first time.The tokens, called inscriptions, function on the Ordinals Protocol. The protocol allows users to embed data on the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.During times of network demand, fees derived from Ordinals they consisted of over 20% of monthly revenue for miners – emerging as a new source of income, one of the network’s most important stakeholders.Bitcoin ETFs to Drive Buying PressureBeyond generally positive onchain fundamentals, bitcoin’s market structure looks beneficial to price post-halving, the report said. Lower rewards are expected to require relatively lower buying pressure to keep prices afloat, which, with increased demand, could translate to higher prices.“Historically, block rewards have introduced potential sell pressure to the market, with the possibility that all newly mined bitcoin could be sold, impacting prices,” Zhao wrote. “Currently, 6.25 bitcoin mined per block equates to approximately $14 billion annually (assuming bitcoin price is $43K).”“In order to maintain current prices, a corresponding buy pressure of $14 billion annually is needed,” he stated, adding that these requirements will decrease “to $7 billion annually” after the halving as rewards fall down to 3.25 bitcoin per block, “effectively easing the selling pressure.”Spot bitcoin ETFs have amassed more than 192,000 bitcoins in holdings as of Friday since their launch nearly a month ago.The funds have only been on the market for less than one month but have already attracted billions of dollars from investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to buy and store it directly.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

At the same time, CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the biggest cryptocurrencies, has risen 11%.The rally happened as continued inflows into the U.S.-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) likely overshadowed reports of bankrupt crypto lender Genesis seeking approval to liquidate its $1.6 billion bitcoin holdings. On Thursday, spot ETFs accumulated over $400 million in inflows, registering the best day in nearly a month.The S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark equity index, rose for the fifth week, closing above the $5,000 mark for the first time on record.According to Amberdata’s Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini, the boom in artificial intelligence-related stocks has driven the index higher, and the bullish momentum bodes well for the crypto market.\"It’s hard to say that AI is overvalued. We’re really at the beginning of the AI story and an explosion of adoption. How do you value the future of AI? It’s definitely unknown, in my opinion. Crypto is in a similar position. [It is] likely a compliment to AI technology given decentralized on-chain data assets and the unknowable future use cases,” Magadini said in an email.“This investor risk appetite for tech is good for crypto and vice versa,” Magadini added.Shares in NVIDIA, which are already up over 40% for the year, are leading the AI-led rally in stocks. Some observers are of the opinion that stocks look expensive, as the S&P 500 equity risk premium has dropped to its lowest since at least 2003.The equity risk premium compares the projected annual corporate earnings growth with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note or the so-called risk-free rate to gauge the relative attractiveness of stocks.The sharp decline in the risk premium means stocks are expensive and Treasury notes are cheap. This does not necessarily imply risk aversion, which leads to outflow from stocks and cryptocurrencies into bonds.“We can see that stocks are expensive (or treasuries are cheap) given this measure. Another way to read this is that risk-on sentiment is very strong in the market,” Magadini noted.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Price trends develop in five stages, according to the theory, of which waves 1, 3, and 5 are \"impulse waves\" representing the main trend. Waves 2 and 4 are retracements between the impulsive price action. BTC completed its wave 4 retracement by correcting to $38,500, according to Thielen, and has now entered its last, fifth impulsive stage of this uptrend targeting $52,000 by mid-March.The overall bull market could run well into next year, peaking sometime between April and September 2025, Thielen said. In an earlier report, he set a $70,000 price target by the end of this year amid supportive macro environment, monetary tailwinds, U.S. election cycle and increasing demand from traditional finance investors.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

At press time, BTC was higher by 4.9% over the past 24 hours to $45,034, modestly outperforming a 4.4% rise for the broader CoinDesk 20 Index.\"Breaking $45,000 allows early investors who piled on the bitcoin ETF to be almost in the money, if we continue this ascent we may even see some profit taken and could trigger a reversal where the $42,000/$40,000 level may be tested,\" said Laurent Ksiss, crypto ETP specialist at CEC Capital.In contrast to Kssis, LMAX Digital said in a morning note to investors that it expects to see bitcoin climb higher, possibly reaching the $50,000 level. \"Technically speaking, bitcoin has broken out of a range and could be looking for a push to a fresh yearly high through $50,000.\"Ether (ETH) was also on the move, rising 3% to reach a two-week high after asset managers Ark Invest and 21Shares yesterday amended their joint spot ETH ETF filing.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesBitcoin rallied to a four-week high approaching $45,000 on Thursday amid record highs in U.S. equity indexes. Bitcoin, which fell as low as $42,700 on Wednesday, climbed almost 5% to $44,800, the highest since Jan. 11, according to CoinDesk data. “Technically speaking, bitcoin has broken out of a range and could be looking for a push to a fresh yearly high through $50,000,” said LMAX Digital in a morning note. According to Laurent Kssis, a crypto ETP specialist at CEC Capital: “This pump is driven by leverage, i.e the open interest on BTC contracts has increased by $982 million in less than 24 hours.” Kssis said he remains cautious, and the $40,000 level could be tested over the weekend. “But overall liquidation indicates a further small appreciation for BTC which will break the key 45k support barrier.” Ether also gained, adding 3% to a two-week high after asset managers Ark Invest and 21Shares amended their joint spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing. The CoinDesk 20 rose 4%.Spot trading volume across centralized crypto exchanges rose for the fourth consecutive month in January, climbing to a level last seen in June 2022 as the approval of bitcoin ETFs sparked renewed interest in digital assets. Volume increased 4.45% from December to $1.40 trillion, according to CCData. The price of bitcoin (BTC) surged going into the Jan. 10 ETF approval but mostly fell after that. “The price action following the highly anticipated approval suggests that the sell-off marked the end of an uptrend that had persisted for months,” said CCData. Binance remains the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, with volume rising 2.73% in January to $473 billion. It holds a market share of 31.3% but did see its spot share gradually decline over 2023 as the company faced an array of charges from regulators that eventually forced founder and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao to step down.There is evidence the Blackrock (BLK) and Fidelity spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) already have an advantage over Grayscale when it comes to certain liquidity metrics linked to market breadth, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. Even though outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC slowed in the fourth week following approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fund is expected to lose out to the newly created ETFs, and in particular to the Blackrock and Fidelity products, if it doesn't make a meaningful cut to its fees, the report said. Grayscale charges the most among spot bitcoin ETF issuers. It dropped its 2% management fee to 1.5% as part of its conversion to a spot bitcoin ETF, but is still much more expensive than rival offerings.Trending PostsMicroStrategy Makes Its Case as Alternative to Spot Bitcoin ETFsEther Tops $2.4K as Cathie Wood's Ark, 21Shares Amend Spot ETH ETF FilingCrypto Firm Bakkt Warns It Might Not Be Able to Remain in BusinessEdited by Sheldon Reback."

A suspension of the process on the first day was followed by multiple postponements.This week's results showed buyers undeterred, with the proceeds well exceeding the $7.5 million that the Taproot Wizards, led by co-founders Udi Wertheimer and Eric Wall, raised from investors last year.The project has ridden a wave of enthusiasm for the Ordinals inscriptions, sometimes referred to as \"NFTs on Bitcoin.\"The Ordinals protocol and its \"inscriptions\" – launched in early 2023 by creator Casey Rodarmor – effectively allows NFTs to be minted and stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.Previous waves of NFT hype were focused on other blockchains, such as Ethereum, that have historically been seen as more programmable than Bitcoin, which is the oldest blockchain and still the largest by market capitalization.Read More: Casey Rodarmor: The Bitcoin ArtistEdited by Bradley Keoun."

Turning to presiding Judge James Mellor, the defendant said, \"If you go into Adobe, My Lord, and I change everything, there's not going to be a font error.\"An alliance of crypto advocates and developers have sued Wright, accusing him of committing forgeries on an “industrial scale” to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin.Sporting a powder-blue, pinstriped, three-piece suit in what attendees described as a menacingly hot London courtroom on Tuesday, Wright curtly denied he’d forged item after item of what he’d previously presented as evidence that he is Satoshi, author of Bitcoin’s foundational document, known as the white paper.Skill issue?Aside from straight denials in the form of “No, that’s actually wrong” or “No, it sure is not” thrown at Bird & Bird LLP’s Jonathan Hough, counsel for the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), Wright attributed inconsistencies in his arguments to everything from self-plagiarizing and printing errors to the illnesses or deaths of various witnesses.For one, Hough asked Wright if he would accept that much of a research paper abstract shared on Twitter called BlackNet – which Wright has said is from 2002 – \"directly reflects language and concepts which are in the bitcoin white paper,\" published in 2008.Wright disputed that characterization, claiming he had reused his own words.“You're again assuming that I have a linear function of how I write,” he told Hough, adding he had multiple versions of both the white paper and his BlackNet abstract.In another instance, when Hough questioned why the computer scientist had obscured the address bar of a web browser while recording separate videos of him purportedly accessing an email account linked to Satoshi, Wright blamed his multitasking skills.“You can't operate a mouse and a phone at the same time?” Hough asked.  “And hold the thing still?\" Wright replied. “No”When asked if Wright, as a forensic documents expert, would view the video as something one would do when trying to fake something, he answered no. Addressing Judge Mellor directly, Wright added: “My Lord, what you would do as someone skilled as I am, is, you would go to the developer bar and access and change online live.”Hemming and hawingHough’s cross-examination continued for a full day, probing key pieces of evidence presented by Wright, including credit card payments, emails, documents and tweets that COPA says prove the computer scientist’s claim of being Satoshi is a “brazen lie.”But when Wright was asked if he would characterize what he and his solicitors had presented so far as the material he “primarily” relies upon to support his claim of being Satoshi, the defendant hesitated.“It's a simple question, Dr. Wright,” Judge Mellor said.On Monday, Mellor had allowed Wright to submit new evidence to the case but warned on Tuesday morning that he likely wouldn’t be allowed to produce anything further. Mellor will allow COPA to examine the new evidence and question Wright on the material if necessary.Wright’s interrogation will continue till at least Feb. 13, according to a tentative schedule shared by the court.The one hope among all in attendance was that the courtroom would be cooler on Wednesday.\"The working atmosphere in this room is extremely oppressive and is not a great advert for the system that we're trying to run here,” Lord Grabiner, counsel for Wright, told Mellor.Edited by Marc Hochstein."

(CryptoQuant)The increased selling happens as the next Bitcoin halving, a quadrennial event when the reward to miners for securing the Bitcoin blockchain is cut by half, is due in April. The halving will have an immense impact on miners' profitability, potentially pushing smaller, less efficient operations out of business or being forced to merge with larger companies to survive, the report explained.Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is Poised to Unleash Darwinism on Miners\"Selling [bitcoin] now provides the capital for miners to upgrade infrastructure and is a reminder of the significant influence on market liquidity and price discovery that miners have,\" Bitfinex analysts said.Continuous selling pressure from the miners perhaps contributes to bitcoin's stalled momentum over the past weeks. BTC corrected as much as 20% following the $49,000 yearly high reached on ETF debut day. The price has since recovered and stabilized above the $40,000 level, but has been rebuffed at a number of attempts to climb above $44,000.While overall outflows from miners have increased, Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, pointed out that the degree of selling from each individual miner was dependent on their operational costs.\"Low-cost miners like CleanSpark (CLSK), Riot (RIOT) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) are selling fewer coins due to their lower cost basis,\" he said in an X post Tuesday. \"In contrast, higher-cost operators such as Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and TeraWulf (WULF) are selling ~100% of their proceeds.\"Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Ethereum was little changed while Optimism’s OP jumped 5% on the day. According to B2C2, an over-the-counter market maker, BTC has witnessed a preference for buyers in the past weeks and could be set to drop in the short-term. “In recent market observations, bitcoin has shown a noticeable preference for buyers, despite the cryptocurrency’s price hovering within a tight range between $42,000 and $43,500 for much of last week,” said Ed Goh, head of trading at B2C2. “Without any immediate news on the horizon and the ETF launch now fully behind us, one might expect that the short-term range of Bitcoin could be reduced in the coming weeks, especially with Chinese New Year on the horizon.” Crypto Finance AG analyst Matteo Bottacini said due to the lightness of the current macroeconomic landscape, “any potential flash-crash is a favourable buying opportunity, especially a downturn towards the $40K level.”A New York judge ordered Ripple Labs to produce certain financial statements and information on the institutional sale of XRP tokens at the request of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), court filings from Monday show. The SEC request, made in early January, follows a pivotal judgment in the lawsuit that accuses the crypto firm of selling unregistered securities in the country. Judge Analisa Torres' ruling last July that only Ripple's institutional sales of XRP broke U.S. law was celebrated by the crypto industry as a victory in its efforts to clarify how regulators treat digital assets. Having found Ripple liable for violations before the lawsuit was filed in 2020, the requested documents will aid Torres in determining whether the court should order injunctions or civil penalties for the period since then and, if warranted, decide how much, the SEC said in its request.Solana suffered a “major outage” on Tuesday, the network’s system status page shows. “Solana Mainnet-Beta is experiencing a performance degradation, block progression is currently halted, core engineers & validators are actively investigating,” said Laine, a Solana validator, in an X post. Blocks seem to have last processed at 09:52 UTC, data from Solana blockchain trackers show. Solana’s SOL token was down just over 4% to $93 over the past 24 hours and dropped 2% after the news surfaced.

This year, however, the shares have fallen 32%. Bitcoin, meantime, is up 2.65%, data from MarketWatch show.The advent of ETFs and their attraction for professional investors endangers some of the sources of Coinbase's revenue, the analysts led by Sandeep Rao said. Previously the investors could gain exposure to bitcoin only through regulated exchanges; now they can do so through the ETFs at lower cost.“Most of the spot bitcoin ETFs offer fees lower than 0.4%, while Coinbase charges between 1.5% to 4%,” Rao said in an interview. “Therefore, investors may prefer to gain exposure to bitcoin via an ETF, which could cause Coinbase’s revenue from bitcoin transactions to decline. Bitcoin transaction fees are around 17% of Coinbase’s total revenue.”But a long-term driver for Coinbase revenues could be the fees it generates by custody of bitcoin for ETF providers. The company is a custodian for eight of the 11 funds and will receive a 0.2% fee and charge additional fees for storing the bitcoin, Rao said.“While it is difficult to quantify the impact of the spot bitcoin ETFs on Coinbase’s revenue in the early days of their listing, over the long-term, the company is likely to be a beneficiary. As Coinbase charges custodial fees based on the total value of each account, not the number of bitcoin, the price of bitcoin is one of the determinants of the value of the funds held in custody,” Rao said.A general rise in crypto markets is also likely to attract more customers, generating higher revenue on trading fees and related services, the analysts concluded.Leverage Shares Outlook for CoinbaseShort-term: Several funds offering fee waivers for the next few months will seemingly reduce Coinbase’s fees, but reduced trading volume since approval is likely to sting more over the next few quarters.Medium-term: Once the initial hype has settled, Coinbase will likely need to revisit its cost structure. However, as recently as the third-quarter earnings call, executives had no immediate plans to reduce transaction fees.Long-term: If more issuers are approved (regardless of whether Coinbase is named custodian), trading volume will continue to slide in favor of the ETPs and Coinbase’s competition for market share will ramp up.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "It looks like the PR battle over how much energy Bitcoin mining consumes is not over after all. A while ago, I declared that it had been won – the tireless pushback from people who actually spend a lot of time researching this had muted the criticism and concern. Facts and reasoning had vanquished fear-mongering and use of trigger words.How naïve.Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a statistics agency under the Department of Energy, fired a handful of salvoes at the Bitcoin ecosystem.One was the announcement that the EIA is launching a mandatory survey of all U.S.-based bitcoin miners.The other was the publication of a report with an “official” estimate of how much energy Bitcoin mining in the U.S. consumes.Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.Let’s take a closer look.The information gatheringStarting this month and until the end of July, the EIA will send regular surveys to all U.S.-based bitcoin miners requesting detailed information on their operations, with a focus on their energy sources and consumption.Information is good, and more detailed insight into Bitcoin energy consumption could finally put to bed – with data – the exaggerated claims from climate activists and hostile regulators.The issue here is that Bitcoin mining is being singled out. No-one is proposing that artificial intelligence projects be subject to the same scrutiny, even though the energy required by their massive data centers is starting to attract attention.What’s more, the information gathering exercise is not starting out from a neutral position.Normally, government surveys have to be signed off by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) after an evaluation of the necessity and level of detail. Approval for the Bitcoin mining survey was solicited via an Emergency Revision Request because, according to the filed document, “public harm is reasonably likely if normal clearance procedures are followed.”What’s the emergency? Where’s the “likely” public harm?From the official request:“As evidence, the price of Bitcoin has increased roughly 50% in the last three months, and higher prices incentivize more cryptomining [sic] activity, which in turn increases electricity consumption.”A-ha.A further clue lies in the published report that accompanied the announcement of the data-gathering exercise.It specifically mentions growing concern about the energy-intensive nature of Bitcoin mining, citing two letters to the U.S. Secretary of Energy from elected officials asking for more detailed information to better identify the impact of Bitcoin mining on emissions. It will come as a surprise to no-one that both of those letters came from Senator Elizabeth Warren and her gang.What the numbers meanAlso in the accompanying report is an estimate of the amount of electricity used by U.S.-based Bitcoin miners. The estimate the agency came up with is between 0.6% and 2.3% of all U.S. electricity consumption. This is a wide band, but nevertheless it is couched in terms to imply that, whatever the actual figure, it’s too much. Even the lower end of the band, the report clarifies, would equal the annual electricity usage for all of Utah, West Virginia or other similar states. The higher end, we’re told, is equivalent to the power consumption of roughly six million homes.Never mind that comparing Bitcoin mining consumption to that of an entire state is like comparing apples to signposts – the former contributes to the maintenance of a global financial network, the latter covers a wide range of industrial, public service, distribution and lifestyle activities. The subliminal implication is that more families could have electricity if Bitcoin mining went elsewhere.Read more: Dan Kuhn - The U.S. Government Seems to Be Closing in on Bitcoin MiningUnsurprisingly, mainstream media got to work crafting headlines to get the outraged clicks. Here are just a few examples I spotted:Bloomberg – US Bitcoin Miners Use as Much Electricity as Everyone in UtahYahoo Finance – Crypto Mining Consumes a Mind-Boggling 2% of U.S. ElectricityArs Technica – Over 2 percent of the US’s electricity generation now goes to bitcoinYet the estimate, even if accurate, makes no mention of the following facts:More than half of U.S.-based Bitcoin mining is done with renewable energy sources.A significant portion of these renewable sources would not be economically viable were it not for Bitcoin miners acting as initial anchor client, enhancing generator profitability and access to finance.Bitcoin miners often use energy that would otherwise be wasted by locating consumption close to the source, adding income that operators can use to improve and extend transmission.Bitcoin’s energy consumption helps mitigate contamination from fossil fuel production by using methane gas that would otherwise be flared into the atmosphere.Bitcoin’s energy consumption helps stabilize grids by acting as an industrial swing consumer – this not only keeps the grid humming when demand is weak, it also provides additional income to grid operators that can finance further grid improvements.Normally, I would assume that this is just another annoying attempt to curtail acceptance of Bitcoin in the U.S., that could be swatted away with reasoning and facts. Yet this has signs of being something more.First, the timing, so soon after the U.S. listing of BTC spot ETFs (which certain regulators were vehemently against), is probably not a coincidence. A secondary objective could be to remind investors that the Administration does not like Bitcoin. This adds a layer of perceived investment risk.Second, the move signals a different attack vector. Since enough reputable studies now show that Bitcoin mining has a net positive environmental impact, antagonistic regulators are trying a new approach: it’s not contamination any more, it’s potential grid strain. The “emergency” authorization request cites the cold weather in the U.S. and the likelihood that entire communities could be left stranded because Bitcoin miners are hogging electricity.This, too, can be swatted away with detailed explanations of how Bitcoin mining’s flexible demand strengthens grid management and stable consumption even during peak demand and climate crises. Meanwhile, however, the implication is used to penalize an industry the regulators don’t like. Here we get to the bigger issue.It’s not just the cost involved, which is considerable. More paperwork invariably generates additional expense. There’s also the likelihood that the resulting database could facilitate further clampdowns. Neither outcome is good, but they’re focused on one industry for now.No, the bigger issue is regulatory prejudice, and the lasting damage that can have on investment in U.S.-based production and innovation.The subliminal implication is that more families could have electricity if Bitcoin mining went elsewhereImagine a country in which regulators decide what energy can be used for. Once they have stamped out one industry, there is a non-zero chance they’ll pivot to another. This adds to the risk of investing in productive capacity, it adds to the financing costs, and it encourages more investment offshore.Bitcoin itself will be fine, whatever the U.S. Administration can throw at it. The network will continue to validate transactions and process blocks, no matter how oppressive certain regimes can become. More supportive regimes will benefit from the business, energy grid support and access to a financial system that does not care about dollar hegemony.Yet this heavy-handed approach will end up hurting more than Bitcoin mining businesses in the U.S. The country has a strong entrepreneurial spirit, a tradition of property protection and deep capital markets. These are worth preserving. It would be such a pity if illogical regulatory antagonism to certain industries ended up hurting the reputation and dynamism of a jurisdiction the world looks to for business inspiration.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."

However, BTCUSD was bought back twice on dips to $42,000,” Kuptsikevich said, adding that “buying on dips” remained a defining sentiment among traders.The trader added that previous catalysts for the crypto market, such as bitcoin ETFs, had already played out – forcing investors to wait for the next signal that could favor volatility.Elsewhere, analysts at crypto exchange Coinbase said in a Friday note that the selling pressure on bitcoin was easing, and macroeconomic factors favor the growth of bitcoin prices.“The technical factors that supported bitcoin’s decline are starting to weaken. In addition, there is steady interest in the spot bitcoin ETFs that have been launched,” Coinbase analysts wrote.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7% versus expectations for a rise to 3.8%.The price of bitcoin (BTC) fell about 0.5% in the minutes following the report, now trading at $42,800.This morning's read on the labor market is of particular interest in that it comes less than two days since the Federal Reserve's January monetary policy meeting. The results of that meeting and Chairman Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference made clear the U.S. central bankers were in no hurry to cut rates even though markets had already nearly fully anticipated such a move at the Fed's next meeting in March.Checking other data from the report finds average hourly earnings up a large 0.6% in January. That's double expectations for 0.3% and above December's 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 4.5% versus 4.1% expected and 4.4% previously. If there was any softness to the report, it was average weekly hours, which slipped to 34.1 versus 34.3 expected and 34.3 previously.The news has sent traditional markets lower, with Nasdaq futures now higher by 0.5% against a gain of more than 1% prior to the report. S&P futures are now up by just 0.2% versus nearly 1% earlier. The 10-year Treasury yield has shot higher by 10 basis points to 3.98% and gold has dropped by 0.6% to $2,059 per ounce."

        "content": "The way futures for ether and bitcoin are currently priced shows traders expect ether to underperform bitcoin in the months ahead.Whether spot ETH ETFs will go live this year remains a question, as the SEC has yet to clarify whether the cryptocurrency is a security or a commodity.Market makers are likely to trade against ether price rises, capping the upside.A week ago, Standard Chartered (STAN) said that ether (ETH) could surge to $4,000 in the next three months, potentially outperforming bitcoin (BTC), as the U.S. SEC could approve spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to ETH in May.Traders, however, continue to prefer bitcoin over ether, anticipating continued weakness in the ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio in the months ahead, futures data show.The ETH/BTC forward term structure, calculated as the ratio between prices for ether futures and bitcoin futures over different maturities, has been sloping downwards, according to data tracked by crypto asset management firm Blofin.“The downward sloping structure is backward, which means that traders expect ETH to perform weaker than BTC as time goes by,” Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said. “This shows investors are relatively more bullish on BTC’s performance.”The term structure slopes downwards, indicating a bias for ether weakness relative to bitcoin. (Blofin) (Blofin)The ETH/BTC ratio surged 17% to 0.059 days after the SEC greenlighted the spot bitcoin ETFs. Ether’s outperformance primarily stemmed from hopes that the regulator will soon approve ether spot ETFs. While those hopes remain alive, the ETH/BTC ratio has since retreated to $0.053.Futures traders may be concerned about the SEC’s categorization of ether as a security or commodity. The SEC’s mid-2023 lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase for violating securities law did not mention ether, which has convinced markets that the cryptocurrency will be deemed a commodity, a necessary condition for spot ETF approval.Investment banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) is skeptical the SEC will classify ether as a commodity by May and sees no more than a 50% chance of the regulatory approving the spot ETH ETFs this year.“There is a lot of uncertainty around the ETH spot ETF, mainly because its Proof-of-Stake could place it in a different asset classification from BTC. Greater uncertainty could also mean greater volatility,\" Singapore-based institutional digital assets trading firm QCP Capital said in the Jan. 29 edition of the “Options Vol-cast” note.The SEC recently delayed decisions on Blackrock (BLK) and Fidelity’s spot ETF applications. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, delays could continue, and the next key date is May 23.Ardern said expectations for relatively weak ether performance likely stem from fears of market makers’ potential hedging activities.According to Ardern, continuous selling of ether higher strike call options or bullish bets has left market makers with a net long gamma exposure. As such, they are likely to sell the cryptocurrency as price rises to hedge their exposure back to neutral. The hedging could inadvertently cap the upside.“One of the reasons investors expect ETH’s relatively weak performance is that a large number of covered calls are dominating the ETH options market, and market makers are holding record positive gamma, which means that any price rise will be faced with strong resistance brought about by dealers’ selling hedging behavior,” Ardern said.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

However, the plan was quickly abandoned in favor of delaying the sale until Thursday. But late Wednesday, on the eve of the resumption, another postponement was announced, until Feb. 5.Some 3,000 of the cats are up for sale, for a fixed price of 0.1 BTC each, so the offering theoretically could raise about $12 million – enough to easily exceed the $7.5 million of investor money that the company raised last year.Taproot Wizards says it underestimated demand from the community to purchase the Quantum Cats. In a post on X, the Quantum Cats handle wrote that the \"issues\" with the minting site had been fixed, but more time is needed for additional testing \"to make sure we don’t discover any other unknown bugs on mint day.\"\"The mint website simply didn’t perform as well as it should have,\" according to the post. \"Ultimately that’s our responsibility and we should’ve done a better job getting this right the first time.\"The Bitcoin Ordinals protocol created quite the stir after its introduction a year, both good and bad.

Sure enough, volatility picked up prior to the recent debut of spot BTC ETFs in the U.S.Now, the monthly chart Bollinger bandwidth has carved out a pattern that preluded Bitcoin's near-vertical rallies of 2016 and late 2020.Created by John Bollinger in the 1980s, Bollinger Bands comprises three bands. The middle one is the 20-period simple moving average of the asset's price. The upper band is two standard deviations above the middle band and the lower band is two standard deviations below it.The Bollinger bandwidth refers to the spread between upper and lower bands measured as the percentage of the moving average. A narrow width is akin to a tightly compressed spring about to make a big move in either direction.Since inception, 1% has been a major low for bitcoin's monthly chart Bollinger bandwidth, with subsequent upturns coinciding with prolonged price rallies or bouts of upside volatility.(TradingView/CoinDesk)The bandwidth has recently bounced from 1% in a positive development for bitcoin bulls.Though the latest bandwidth pattern resembles developments before previous bull runs, the indicator, by itself, only signals that a major price move is due but doesn't tell us anything about the direction.In other words, past results do not guarantee future performance, and the possibility of a large move to the downside cannot be ruled out.That said, most analysts are bullish on the cryptocurrency, expecting the recently launched spot ETFs to accelerate adoption and lift prices to new record highs above $69,000 in the next 12 months.Edited by Oliver Knight."

Market participants were more keen to monitor clues about when the Fed might start lowering rates, with many observers expecting it to happen as soon as the next meeting in March.\"Based on the meeting today,\" said Powell at his post-meeting press conference, \"I don't think it's likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to [cut].\"Risk assets including cryptos turned sharply lower in the immediate aftermath of that remark. BTC fell to $42,300 from its daily high of $43,700 and was down 2.3% over the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, a broad crypto market benchmark that covers some 90% of the total market value of digital assets, declined nearly 3% during the same time.Other major cryptocurrencies such as ether (ETH), Cardano's ADA, Avalanche's AVAX and Polkadot's DOT dropped 3%-4%, while Solana's SOL lost over 6% during the day buckling below $100.In traditional markets, the Nasdaq tumbled 2.2% and the S&P 500 1.6%.\"The market has gotten ahead of itself on the rates side,\" Alex Krüger, macro analyst and co-founder of Asgard Markets, said in a X post. \"Cuts starting in May or June, not March.\"Indeed, the odds of a March rate cut have been trimmed to a current 34.5% from about 65% prior to today's developments, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at Web3 fintech platform YouHodler, said that \"any possible hawkish rhetoric about the longer-than-expected time of high rates may trigger a correction in the stock market and as a consequence, capital outflow from risk assets such as bitcoin.\"However, bitcoin's move to downside could be limited as the largest crypto appears to be consolidating between $44,000 and $42,000 without clear direction, Swissblock analysts said in a Wednesday market report.The $42,000 area and below the $40,000 level could act as key support levels for the price where buyers might step in, the report added.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

        "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday, as expected, held policy steady, leaving its benchmark fed funds rate range unchanged at 5.25%-5.50%, but perhaps dented market hopes of a rate cut at its next meeting in March.\"The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,\" said the central bank in its policy announcement.Though market watchers universally expected the Fed to remain on hold today, the outlook is quite a bit different for the remainder of the year. Prior to today's news, investors had priced in nearly a 65% chance of at least one 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in March, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. In addition to that, investors are anticipating a series of Fed rate cuts throughout the remainder of 2024. Shortly after the policy announcement, those March rate cut odds had been trimmed to just over 50%.The price of bitcoin (BTC) was little-changed in the minutes following today's Fed announcement, continuing at about $43,500. Bitcoin has been volatile of late, but is roughly flat over the past several weeks. That time frame has been dominated by the run-up to the spot ETF approvals and then the initial weeks of trading for those vehicles. Bulls are hopeful that a string of rate cuts, alongside demand from the new ETFs and the upcoming April halving (at which fresh daily bitcoin supply will be reduced by 50%), could set off a fresh run to new highs.A check of traditional markets finds the S&P 500 and Nasdaq at about session lows, down 1% and 1.5%, respectively.Five Democratic Senators earlier this week threw their hats in the monetary policy ring. First, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) led a group of four urging Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut \"astronomical rates.\" Then yesterday Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, requested similar action.Powell's post-meeting press conference, at which he'll likely to be asked about those Senatorial concerns, begins at 2:30 pm ET."

        "content": "One of the critical ingredients for Bitcoin’s success has been the emergence of new trading infrastructure and investment wrappers that open access to new investors. This trend is now in overdrive with the recent launch of spot BTC ETFs.Beyond the circles of liquidity providers and trading desks, we haven’t quite appreciated how these monumental changes will change the Bitcoin market structure.We can expect reduced inherent volatility as this market structure matures. Here, we will explore how a couple of important shifts associated with the launching spot ETFs are poised to facilitate this change.You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.ETF Fix as a Market Price Reference?It is no secret that the recent ETF launches have yielded a meaningful uptick in the underlying spot BTC trading volumes. Notably, a disproportionate share of this volume increase has happened mostly between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. ET, or close to the ETF price fix.The chart below shows the daily BTC trading volume percentage in the 30-minute buckets starting at 3:00 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. ET for the leading trading pairs. Activity from these two buckets, which regularly accounted for less than 5% of the total daily volume in aggregate, now represents 10-13%.By providing a transparent and consistent reference point recognized by increasing market participants, the ETF fix allows investors to aggregate large trades around a common time, reducing their market impact and overall market volatility.A New Options Market Around ETFs?All three exchanges that currently list spot BTC ETFs have already asked the SEC to allow them to list options on such ETFs. It could take anything between one and eight months for those applications to be evaluated by the SEC, and there are wrinkles related to their clearing and settlement processes.The Bitcoin options market will likely get a significant boost if this new class of options is given the green light. The Bitcoin options market is currently split between investors who trade in offshore exchanges inaccessible to U.S. persons or on platforms accessible only to large institutions, such as the CME. Allowing options based on spot BTC ETFs could significantly expand the options market beyond these two markets.Overall, the BTC options market should continue to increase in importance in 2024, even after the massive growth it posted last year. A more developed options market can yield lower volatility because it allows investors to express a broader range of investment strategies and make the most liquid ETFs even more liquid. It also expands the importance of events such as expirations and dealer positioning as price action drivers.20-Year ETF Legacy Meets the Bitcoin RevolutionIt’s exciting to see the ETF revolution now benefit the bitcoin market. The launch of spot BTC ETFs has brought, and will likely continue to bring, an increase in investor participation, perhaps similar to the gold ETF launch in the early 2000s.More than two weeks into launch, the spot bitcoin ETFs are already clocking in at over $1.5 billion daily trading volume. For context, this volume is about 20% of what bitcoin trades in the spot market on a good day.As the innovation in crypto ETFs continues, we expect trading activity related to ETFs to continue, which should dampen Bitcoin’s volatility and contribute to the maturation of this emerging asset class.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."

At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $42,580, down 2.25% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin looks set to end the month roughly midway between its high of around $47,000, hit after the first spot BTC ETFs listed in the U.S., and the low of about $38,500, which it hit two weeks later. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which measures the performance of the top digital assets, is down 3.11%. Solana's SOL, Cardando's ADA and Avalanche's AVAX have been among the biggest decliners, down 6.7%, 5.4% and 6.2% respectively.Indexes tracking NFTs have risen almost 10% in January. Meanwhile ether, the cryptocurrency in which many of them are denominated, has gained just over 2%. The gains stand out because NFT prices in ether initially did not keep up with the cryptocurrency's year-end advance. Traders, however, seem to have changed their minds as the hunt for utility, or real-world uses, is on. NFT-focused VC firm Animoca Brands' founder, Yat Siu, told CoinDesk in an interview that he attributed the rally to the newfound maturity and diversity of the sector. \"The majority of the speculators in the NFT space have left, which strengthened the foundation as the remaining people are genuinely interested,\" he said.Solana-based decentralized trading aggregator Jupiter will unveil its native token at 10.00 EST (15:00 UTC) with an initial circulating supply of 1.35 billion.

It claims to be a Bitcoin layer 2 protocol powered by zero-knowledge rollup technology – a string of terms that, together, can be thought of as a network that settles transactions on Bitcoin without having to share extra data with network validators.SAVM was one of the most-hyped token issuances in recent months. It jumped several thousand percent to a market capitalization of as high as $90 million a few hours after issuance, DEXTools data shows.But the controversy began shortly after it went live on Jan.19. Data cited by on-chain analysis tool @bubblemaps shows 15% of the token’s supply was sent to a handful of wallets supposedly owned by market influencers who “immediately sold upon receiving the tokens.”Some prominent investors who participated in SatoshiVM’s private sale confirmed they took profits from their positions – but faced backlash as market observers questioned the motive of selling allocations in the first few hours after issuance.Analysis service @Lookonchain reported a wallet that received SAVM tokens from the publicly-known SatoshiVM team wallet received upward of $4 million worth of tokens after launch, selling $1.2 million worth in the first 48 hours after issuance.The SatoshiVM has, so far, thwarted all accusations and is holding a community ask-me-anything session on Thursday to directly answer queries. The team did not immediately respond to an X message sent by CoinDesk in Asian morning hours on Thursday.Meanwhile, SAVM tokens have shown resilience amid the ongoing controversy. Prices have ranged in the $7 and $14 bands since Jan.19 and remain a hot favorite among retail traders on X.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

The most recent example of note would be the mortgage backed security bubble that led to the global financial crisis 15 years ago.It remains to be seen what lies ahead for bitcoin, but industry experts for now are applauding the move by Bitwise.\"[An] important first step toward onchain accounting,” prominent Silicon Valley investor and former chief technology officer at Coinbase Balaji Srinivasan wrote.\"Love this from Bitwise,\" said Nate Geraci, president of investment advisory firm ETF Store. \"Transparency of ETF wrapper plus onchain transparency.

Since the spot bitcoin ETFs opened for business on Jan. 11, Grayscale has now moved nearly 113,000 bitcoin from its wallet, the overwhelming majority of which was to Coinbase Prime in preparation for sale, according to data compiled from Arkham.The Grayscale website Wednesday morning showed GBTC as holding roughly 537,000 bitcoin, down about 100,000 BTC since Jan. 11.As Arkham noted, one caveat to the observed movement of bitcoin out of the Grayscale wallet is that not all of that may be related to redemption. \"The outflows are usually split between Coinbase Prime and new GBTC custody addresses,\" said Arkham. \"This means that not all of the BTC moved is being redeemed. The outflows appear to be settlements of trading activity for the previous day(s).\"GBTC has seen this massive outflow for any number of reasons, but principally as Grayscale cut its management fee just 50 basis points to 1.50% following the conversion to a spot ETF. That's more than 100 basis points higher than the other nine competing bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale has now seen the departure of more than 10,000 bitcoin per day for several days running. The exit of bitcoin combined with the decline in the price of bitcoin has led to a fall in assets under management (AUM) by more than $1 billion each day this week.The hopes of bitcoin bulls were momentarily buoyed earlier this week on a Monday CoinDesk report that the FTX estate had unloaded its 22 million share GBTC holding. With this non-economic whale seller out of the way, the bulls hoped there might be a slowdown in GBTC exits. To this point though, this hasn't happened, as evidenced by this morning's movement of 19,000 bitcoin to exchange.Read more: Crypto Whales Hunt for Bargains As Bitcoin Prices Slide, Data ShowsUpdate (1/25/2024 14:50 UTC): Adds detail noting the decline in AUM is due a combination of reduced bitcoin in fund and lower prices.

Issuance of the token has nothing to do with Trump directly, but some are using the tokens as a speculative bet on his ongoing presidential campaign. The tokens have a market capitalization of over $85 million on Wednesday, data shows. Sending tokens to a popular entity’s wallet is sometimes used as a strategy for attracting eyeballs by meme coin makers. The value of Trump’s wallet has shot up to $2.5 million, holding over $750,000 each in ether and wrapped ether and tiny amounts of several other tokens, most of which were likely sent to the wallet unsolicited.Chart of The Day(Velo Data)The notional open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, has dropped by nearly $1.5 billion since the launch of spot ETFs in the U.S.According to Reflexivity Research, the decline represents the unwinding of longs betting on ETF approvals and entities using BITO/CME futures as a liquidity bridging vehicle leading into the ETF launches.Authorized participants likely bought bitcoin before the launch while simultaneously selling CME futures or BITO to hedge their risks.Source: Velo Data- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsIndonesia's Crypto Tax Revenue Falls 63% in 2023 Despite Bitcoin's SurgeTornado Cash Developers Storm, Pertsev Raise Over $350K for Legal Defense With Support From SnowdenThe Promises and Perils of NFTs: An Excerpt From 'The Everything Token'Edited by Omkar Godbole."

The Fed's benchmark interest rate currently stands between 5.25% to 5.5%, having raised the borrowing cost by 525 basis points between March 2022 and July 2023.

According to ING, shipowners are increasingly choosing the longer and more expensive route via Southern Africa.That has raised concerns about supply disruptions and higher energy prices, which could translate into higher inflation, as seen following the coronavirus-induced global lockdown of 2020. Central banks, including the Fed, would have scant leeway to cut rates if inflation rebounds at a time when wage growth remains sticky.\"This rerouting affects 20% to 30% of all shipping globally and adds considerable time and expense. For an inflation statistician, anything that travels by ship will get more expensive, all else being equal. Given that inflation operates at a considerable lag, if this situation persists, the effects will only appear many months from now,\" Arthur Hayes, the chief investment officer of family office Maelstrom and the ex-CEO of BitMEX, said in a blog post, explaining the potential for bitcoin to fall below $35,000 in the near-term.\"While the markets are cheering YoY inflation statistics falling in the U.S. and elsewhere, it might be a pyrrhic victory,\" Hayes added.Edited by Oliver Knight."

The short-term band, represented by green lines, comprises 3-day, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15-day EMAs, and the long-term band, identified by the red color, comprises 30-day, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 60-day EMAs.A bearish-to-bullish trend change occurs when the green band crosses above the red band. A bearish shift in momentum occurs when the green band crosses below the red band. Most traders tend to be trend-following, preferring to enter when the crossover appears and hold in the direction of the long-term trend.At press time, the GMMA looked set to produce a bearish crossover, with the green band nearly moving below the red band.

The auction started on Jan. 12 and concluded on Monday.The sale price for Genesis Cat was more than 12 times the estimated $15,000 to $20,000 for the lot, and comes after Sotheby's last month sold three pixelated images from the \"BitcoinShrooms\" collection for a combined $450,000.The cat image was sold as part of the \"Ordinals Curated Sale,\" consisting of 19 lots from 11 different artists.

Recent downward pressure on bitcoin has been attributed to sales stemming from Grayscale’s GBTC bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), as per some analysts, including Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. However, other newly approved bitcoin ETFs are seeing net inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC ETFs crossed $1 billion last week, data tracked by CoinGlass shows, indicative of buying pressure.Meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and floki (FLOKI) rose as much as 12% before retreating, as an @xpayments profile on X (formerly Twitter) sent adoption hopes flying among crypto circles. There is speculation that advertisers could use DOGE for ads and other purposes on the social media site. Trading volumes for both tokens shot up 200% over the weekend, CoinGecko data shows, even as broader crypto volumes remained relatively lower amid little volatility. Elsewhere, futures tracking the tokens saw open interest rise to a cumulative $430 million from $200 million, indicative of rising bets. However, broader market downward pressure took hold during European morning hours, with both down over 5% on the day at the time of writing.Terraform Labs, developer of the failed stablecoin TerraUSD which collapsed in May 2022, has filed for bankruptcy. Documents filed in Delaware on Jan. 21 say that the firm has between $100 million to $500 million in assets and the same amount in liabilities. \"The filing will allow TFL to execute on its business plan while navigating ongoing legal proceedings, including representative litigation pending in Singapore and U.S. litigation\" Terraform Labs said in a statement. Amongst the list of unsecured creditors are TQ Ventures, a U.S.-based digital assets investment fund, and Standard Crypto, a San Francisco-based venture fund.Chart of The Day(Coinbase, Coinmetrics, Bloomberg)The chart shows the basis between bitcoin and ether CME futures and the spot prices of the two cryptocurrencies.The premium in bitcoin futures has narrowed to less than 0.5%, down significantly from the year-to-date high of over 4% seen before the debut of 11 spot ETFs in the U.S. on Jan. 11. Ether futures seem to be following bitcoin's lead.Traders may have sold futures while simultaneously buying cryptocurrencies early this month to pocket the elevated premium. That, coupled with a leverage shakeout after ETFs' debut, likely pushed the premium lower.Source: Coinbase, Coinmetrics, Bloomberg- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsWhy Indonesia’s Upcoming Elections Could Make or Break the Country’s Vibrant Crypto SectorHe Exposed Harvard President's Plagiarism, Then Lost Money Betting on the StoryCrypto Backers B.

        "content": "Daily trading volume in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has tanked since spot ETFs went live in the U.S. on Jan. 11.Observers said BITO will remain an integral part of the market as a hedging instrument.Activity in ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the world’s leading bitcoin (BTC) futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), has cooled significantly since the launch of ETFs directly investing in the cryptocurrency began trading in the U.S. on Jan. 11.On Thursday, BITO shares worth just over $500 million changed hands on the NYSE, a 75% slide from the record $2 billion registered on Jan. 11, according to data tracked by crypto exchange Coinbase. BITO has witnessed a net outflow of over $270 million over the same period, according to data source ETF.com.Meanwhile, 11 spot ETFs registered a cumulative trading volume of $14 billion in the first week, a tally bigger than all other ETFs launched in 2023, per Coinbase. These funds have amassed over $1.2 billion in investor money in one week since inception.These spot ETFs invest in bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency while bypassing the hassles of storing the same and are considered a better alternative to futures-based ETFs like BITO. Because BITO invests in the CME BTC futures, it must roll over expiring contracts into new ones, incurring “roll costs,” which weigh over the fund’s performance in the long run.That said, the cash-creation structure of spot ETFs will likely ensure futures-based ETFs stay relevant, according to some observers.ETFs are created and redeemed in two ways: In-kind and cash creation. In the former, when the ETF issuer wants to create new shares, the authorized participant (AP) buys the underlying securities comprising the ETF and delivers the same to the issuer in return for a block of ETF shares, which can be sold in the open market. The process works in reverse when the ETF wants to redeem shares.The process remains the same in the cash-creation structure, except that APs provide cash to the issuer, and then the issuer purchases the actual asset.That exposes APs – institutions and market-making firms – to the risk of bitcoin price fluctuations between when they receive buy orders and when issuers purchase the asset to create new shares. As such, APs are likely to hedge the same with regulated products like BITO and CME futures, according to some observers.“It is not unusual for an AP to revert to regulated products such as BITO to hedge their positions (called deltas) as they may not have accounts with CME futures to do so. This is generally considered a good proxy if they can’t execute CME bitcoin futures or even outright bitcoin,” Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital and a former ETF market maker, told CoinDesk.“The risk of being exposed or unhedged is very high, so BITO will provide decent cover, although it is not a perfect hedge as there is slippage and a decent cost to buy BITO,” Kssis added. “But many APs won’t have a choice (since they can’t buy bitcoin or are not allowed to touch them by their compliance dept) or even won’t have the infrastructure, i.e., custodian, or back office system to reconcile their positions.”David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, said in the weekly newsletter that despite the recent decline in BITO’s volume, it will remain an “integral part of the bitcoin ETF space.”“We believe some APs (namely broker-dealers) will continue to rely on regulated means of hedging themselves, such as long CME futures or long BITO when creating shares (or short CME futures if redeeming),” Duong said, adding some APs likely bought bitcoin ahead of the spot ETF launch and sold BITO to “to hedge potential client buys and sells intraday.”Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "In recent times, we've witnessed real-world scenarios where stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC have become crucial monetary tools. In Turkey, for instance, where high inflation has spurred citizens to embrace these digital assets as a hedge against an unstable national currency.Stablecoins promise liberation from the traditional financial systems' constraints, but how well they actually deliver on this promise depends on how one defines freedom. If we measure stablecoins against various definitions of freedom as they appear in political science literature, this new form of money falls short.Burak Tamaç is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University.UnmuteTo understand why stablecoins fail when it comes to personal liberty — and why bitcoin (BTC) succeeds — it’s helpful to take a tour of a few political philosophers, and how they define freedom.Lets’ begin with the Anglo-Russian political theorist Isaiah Berlin, and his seminal essay “Two Concepts of Liberty” which says freedom can primarily be understood in two ways: negative and positive. Negative freedom, often termed \"liberal freedom,\" refers to the absence of interference or barriers. Being left alone, in other words. In contrast, positive freedom focuses on the active exercise of freedom to realize a goal or potential.See also: Americans (Seemingly) Aren't Allowed to Put This Economic Theory to TestThere is also a third alternative, the \"republican\" or \"neo-Roman\" conception of freedom, which draws on both of these interpretations to raise questions about governance. Irish philosopher Phillip Pettit was a pioneer in this field, and stressed a view of republican freedom as an absence of domination, while later British intellectual historian Quentin Skinner emphasized freedom from dependance. For both, the mere presence of an arbitrary power that can interfere in one's life does not make one free.Before turning back to crypto, let's look at freedom another way — using an analogy of a door. Imagine negative freedom as having a choice of many doors, and positive freedom as walking through your selected door. Republican freedom brings another layer — it's like having a bunch of doors without a gatekeeper.In this sense, you're free as long as no one interferes. This is similar to a the liberal conception of freedom mentioned above, but from the republican viewpoint the mere potential of interference already limits your freedom. In other words, to manage this gatekeeper, we need positive freedom solely to secure our negative freedom.Whether the power is held by a government or a company, the problem of arbitrary power remainsWith this lens, the issue with stablecoins becomes clear. Stablecoins could be said to offer negative freedom, in that there are few barriers to using these financial systems as long as the system runs smoothly. However, they miss the mark on republican freedom, or freedom without domination.Here's the problem: these assets are created and managed by centralized organizations. The stability and accessibility of stablecoins, along with their users, are tied to these companies' decisions. You're free until someone interferes. But crucially, that freedom is at the issuers' mercy.See also: Why Care About Bitcoin? Here's One Philosopher's Take | Opinion (2021)Look at the recent situation in my native Turkey. With a national banking system crisis and inflation, many Turkish citizens are using stablecoins, specifically USDT on Tron, to protect their wealth. It sounds attractive at first: Instead of relying on the government to oversee banks, trust foreign companies. But from a certain standpoint, this just replaces one boss with another.Whether the power is held by a government or a company, the problem of arbitrary power remains — and that is the lesson of republican freedom. You may still be under external control, unable to significantly influence the processes that govern your economic activities.Bitcoin, however, offers a truly decentralized option, getting us closer to freedom as non-domination. Bitcoin's decentralized nature prevents the type of domination that comes with the centralized structures of stablecoins or traditional finance. Each participant can impact the network's decisions, reducing the risk of arbitrary power, and thus fostering a more republican view of freedom.In conclusion, stablecoins might seem like a lifeline in unstable financial landscapes. But their intrinsic reliance on centralized issuers compromises freedom as non-domination. It is not enough to swap one master for another, be it a government or a corporation. Real financial independence comes not from trading chains, but from eliminating or controlling them."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) options now look cheap and some traders are taking advantage of the same to raise bullish bets.Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call gives the right to buy and allows traders to profit from or hedge against price rallies, whereas a put option does the opposite.Traders consider options cheap when implied volatility, one of the key determinants of options prices, slides below its long-term average or under the asset’s realized volatility. Implied volatility is the one standard deviation range of the expected movement of the underlying asset’s price over a year and tends to be mean-reverting. Realized volatility is the price movement that has already happened.Bitcoin’s implied volatility (IV) peaked with the launch of spot ETFs in the U.S. last week and has dropped below the realized volatility, stoking demand for calls at strikes $45,000 and $46,000 during Thursday’s North American trading hours, according to over-the-counter institutional cryptocurrency trading network Paradigm.“We saw a large buyer of Feb $44k straddles and some outright call buying in the $45k /$46k strikes,” Paradigm said in a Telegram broadcast. “BTC implied [volatility] now trades well under-realized [volatility], so [we are] not surprised to see Paradigm customers playing for a sharp rally back in spot and vol.”The word outright call buying implies that calls purchased were likely standalone trades, betting on renewed upside price volatility in bitcoin and not a part of a complex strategy. Since early 2023, bitcoin’s price and implied volatility have been mostly positively correlated.A straddle is a non-directional strategy involving the simultaneous purchase of call and put options at the same strike price. Its purpose is to profit from an expected spike in implied volatility and the resulting rise in options prices.Bitcoin has dropped over 15% since the ETF debuted on Jan. 11, with prices briefly falling below $41,000 late Thursday.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

JPMorgan previously estimated that up to $3 billion had been invested in GBTC in the secondary market during 2023 to exploit the trust’s discount to NAV. If this estimate is correct, there could be an additional $1.5 billion to exit the space via profit-taking on GBTC, which will put further pressure on bitcoin prices in the coming weeks.Ether (ETH) could be poised to soar in 2024 on the back of hopes of a spot ETH ETF listing, analysts at Coinbase (COIN) have said. ETH reached its highest price since May 2022 following the approval of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. last week. Several of the firms behind BTC ETFs, such as BlackRock and VanEck, are plotting similar products for ETH, Coinbase said in a weekly newsletter. Aside from ETF hopes, Ethereum's upcoming Dencun upgrade, which aims to improve the mainnet's scalability, could galvanize investor interest in ETH. Institutional crypto firm ETC Group said in its annual report that ether has a bullish outlook given Ethereum's ongoing status as the most dominant blockchain for DeFi and the extra returns users can accrue through staking their coins.ARK Invest sold a further $15 million worth of shares in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) on Wednesday, adding to the $15.8 million worth it sold the day before. ARK essentially swapped the BITO shares for $15 million worth of its own spot bitcoin ETF (ARKB). ProShare's bitcoin product was the first ETF tied to the BTC futures market to list in the U.S. back in October 2021. ARK sold off its shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust late last year in favor of BITO, anticipating the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Now the approval has happened, ARK is pivoting toward its own product.Chart of The Day(Glassnode)The chart shows bitcoin's monthly net position change or the 30-day change in supply held by long-term holders.

        "content": "Investors are likely to have a relook at ether as the spot ETF narrative gathers steam and Ethereum remains the dominant chain in the DeFi and NFT world, according to analysts.Ether is qualified to be a core holding in a diversified crypto portfolio, one observer said.Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, underperformed bitcoin (BTC) in 2023, as the latter’s new-found smart contract, non-fungible tokens (NFT) narrative, and spot ETF optimism drew investor money.Per analysts, investors will likely have a relook at ether this year as Ethereum is still the world’s leading smart contract blockchain with key upgrades lined up, and ether is widely seen as the next likely candidate to get a spot-based ETF in the U.S.“ETH could be poised for a breakout year,” Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase said in the weekly newsletter. “Last week’s bitcoin ETF news proved to be a boon for ethereum, which briefly spiked above $2,700 — reaching its highest price since May 2022. And there are reasons to be even more optimistic about ETH’s near-term future. For one, several of the firms behind the BTC ETFs — including BlackRock and VanEck — are also plotting ether-based spot ETFs.”A spot ETF invests in actual cryptocurrency, allowing investors to take exposure to the asset without having to own it, and is considered a better option than futures-based ETFs, which are vulnerable to roll costs. So, just as spot BTC ETFs, a potential launch of spot ETH ETFs is expected to open floodgates to institutional and retail money.Nearly a dozen bitcoin spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. last Thursday and have registered a cumulative volume of over $10 billion, with BlackRock’s product amassing $1 billion in inflows.Dencun upgrade and institutional demandIn addition, Ethereum’s upcoming Dencun upgrade, which aims to improve the mainnet’s scalability by introducing “data blobs,” could galvanize investor interest in the cryptocurrency, according to Coinbase. The upgrade went live on Ethereum’s Goerli testnet early this week.A blob is a temporary transaction data memory typically related to Layer 2 solutions that can be attached to Ethereum. Following the upgrade to the mainnet, the network will only need to confirm the correctness of the blob data attached to the block rather than verify each transaction, helping reduce congestion and network fees.“Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade began initial tests on Wednesday and in coming months is expected to implement EIP-4844 (“EIP” stands for “Ethereum improvement proposal”), which some ETH watchers predict could help reduce network fees by 90% or more,” Coinbase noted.Institutional crypto firm ETC Group, in its annual report, discussed a bullish outlook for the ether-bitcoin ratio and explained that despite 2023's inscriptions-led boom in Bitcoin's network activity, Ethereum remains the dominant chain for building decentralized applications, NFTs, and tokenized assets.For instance, data tracked by ETC Group show, the top 10 ERC-20 tokens have a cumulative market value of $21 billion – or 13 times bigger than the $1.6 billion market capitalization of the entire BRC-20 token universe of over 37,000 coins. ERC-20 is Ethereum’s token standard, while BRC-20 is a fungible digital asset created on the Bitcoin network.Further, ether investors can generate extra returns on top of their holdings by staking or locking their coins in the network in return for rewards. The current annualized reward rate is around 3.84%, having averaged about 4% to 5% since Ethereum completed the Merge in September 2022.Lastly, Ethereum's feature of burning a portion of transaction fees paid in ETH has a deflationary effect on the token's supply, positively affecting investors.\"The strong dominance of Ethereum in terms of smart contract platforms and the possibility to earn an additional source of yield imply that it should also be a core holding in a diversified cryptoasset portfolio as well,\" ETC Group said. \"We therefore think that it is quite likely for the relative performance of ETH/BTC to reverse itself in 2024. In fact, ETH/BTC’s 12-month relative performance has historically shown a strong tendency to mean revert,\" ETC Group added.Ether has outperformed bitcoin so far this year, with the ether-bitcoin ratio (ETH/BTC) trading 10% higher. The ratio tanked over 25% last year.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Dozens of layer-2 projects have sprouted in the Ethereum ecosystem over the past year including Base, from the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, and big projects like Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon are now pushing to foster additional networks based on their own blueprints.The layer-2 networks on Bitcoin are early stage compared to those on other blockchains but are growing, according to the authors.Bitcoin is now well placed to unlock its potential with layered architecture to mirror that on Ethereum, according to the report, arguing that the emergence of the Ordinals protocol a year ago \"brought a renaissance of Bitcoin builder culture.\"Ordinals enabled the network to host non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and paved the way for the BRC-20 token standard, which uses a different technology from Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens but plays off the concept.The 'Big Four'The limitations of Bitcoin to a large extent revolve around a lack of programmability or application functionality and slow transaction speeds, the report argues.Where Bitcoin's Lightning Network has strived to bring faster payments to Bitcoin for a number of years, other layers are aiming to bring functionalities such as programmability and application functionality to imbue utility on the network beyond storing value.Along with Lightning, layer-2 projects Stacks, Liquid and Rootstock make up what the report refers to as the \"Big Four,\" which on a combined basis make up the majority of L2 transactions and have focused on bringing smart contract and faster transaction speeds to Bitcoin.The projects will need refinement so they don't fall victim to the inherent limitations of the Bitcoin network, according to the authors. One particular upgrade on the radar is Stacks' Nakamoto Release, designed to enable cheap BTC transfers on a L2, improving transaction speeds to around five seconds instead of 10 to 30 minutes or even more.Beyond these four, there is a sizeable list of emerging innovations on Bitcoin which can fill the existing technical gaps, of which the report singles out a few.Ark, for example, is a L2 protocol allowing off-chain payments in which recipients receive payments without acquiring inbound liquidity, with the goal of lower costs than Lightning.MintLayer is another which is designed to act as Bitcoin sidechain optimized for DeFi-related activities.Such developments could capitalize on Bitcoin's tailwinds from the recent listing of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. and the forthcoming halving to inspire new use cases for Bitcoin and in turn spurring further adoption.Read More: Bitcoin Inscriptions Divide BTC Community Amid Network Congestion, but Are 'Unstoppable'Edited by Bradley Keoun."

Bitcoin prices fell as low as 15% after the much-awaited ETF listing last week, with outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust product said to contribute to the downward pressure. ETF volume data provided by BlackRock (BLK), Fidelity and Bitwise cumulatively crossed the $500 million mark earlier this week – indicating demand from regulated funds and professional traders. Coinbase (COIN), the custodian for several ETF providers, saw record-high OTC desk transfer volumes. “Several on-chain metrics and indicators still suggest the price correction may not be over or at least that a new rally is still not on the cards,” CryptoQuant analysts said. “Short-term traders and large bitcoin holders are still doing significant selling in a context of “risk-off” attitude.Decentralized exchange dYdX, which recently migrated from Ethereum to Cosmos, has replaced one of Uniswap's markets as the largest DEX by daily trading volume, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The Cosmos-based v4 version of dYdX just saw $757 million of volume over a 24-hour period, topping Uniswap v3, which had $608 million, the data shows. dYdX's v3 market, which still operates, had $567 million, enough for third place. According to dYdX, the total trade volume so far for its v4 market since launch is $17.8 billion. In 2023, dYdX's v3 saw a total of over $1 trillion in trading volume, with several days exceeding $2 billion of trading volume.Former President and front-runner in the Republican leadership race, Donald Trump, has promised to ban the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. \"As your president, I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency,” Trump said on stage, joined by crypto-friendly former candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who recently suspended his campaign. “This would be a dangerous threat to freedom, and I will stop it from coming to America,” Trump continued. “Such a currency would give a federal government absolute control over your money. They could take your money, and you wouldn’t even know it was gone.”Chart of The DayThe chart shows the S&P 500 in inflation-adjusted terms, the spread between U.S. 10 and two-year Treasury bond yields, and the Fed funds rate (the benchmark borrowing cost) since 1999.Fed's pivot to rate cuts or renewed liquidity easing typically comes from the point of economic weakness, coinciding with a bearish trend reversal and a sell-off in the S&P 500, as observed in 2000, 2008, and late 2019.The market expects the Fed to cut rates by over 100 basis points this year.Source: ByteTree Research, Bloomberg- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsSui Teams Up With Oracle Stork to Provide Builders With Fast Pricing DataInvestment Firm With $1B Assets Looks to Invest in Bitcoin Mining With Fabiano ConsultingTrueUSD Wobbles Towards $1 Peg Amid Reported Redemption IssuesEdited by Omkar Godbole."

The firm was among the few to take a contrarian view of the bitcoin ETF approvals, one that many traders expected would lead to price gains after they went live.Crypto traders shared the sentiment, pointing out that any strength in an upside was dampened as spot sales seemed to occur.“Although bitcoin's intraday range exceeded 3.5%, reaching the highs of the recent trading range triggered a methodical sell-off early on Wednesday,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in an email to CoinDesk.“Intraday dynamics instead point to methodical selling near local highs, while bounces are occurring sharply and with less volume. This is a cautionary observation but not at all a verdict on the cryptocurrency bull market,” Kuptsikevich added.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "With three full days of trading in the books as of the close of business on Tuesday, net inflows into the newly approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds appear to be about 21,000 bitcoin (BTC), or $894 million at the current price of $42,600.Of the new money, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leads the way by adding 16,362 bitcoin, followed by Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with 12,112 bitcoin. Sizable exits from Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has lost about 25,000 bitcoin, brought down the overall industry inflow.Until the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission blessed bitcoin ETFs last week, GBTC had existed as a closed-end fund. It was converted into an ETF as the other new products from the likes of BlackRock debuted last week. GBTC had charged customers a 2% management fee and held about 630,000 bitcoin prior to the spot ETF approvals.While the ETF version of GBTC charges a reduced management fee of 1.5%, that is still at least 100 basis points more than its new competitors. In addition, its conversion to an ETF meant the fund no longer traded at a discount to net asset value (NAV). Combined, these two factors have given GBTC holders good reason to sell and the early returns suggest that's occurring.Read more: Grayscale Moves Another 9K Bitcoin to Exchange in Preparation for SaleNonetheless, the new money coming into the ETFs overshadowed that, leading to the net inflows into ETFs overall.Price action has been far quieter this week, with bitcoin mostly settling into the $42,000-$43,000 range. At press time, it's lower by just over 1% over the past 24 hours, slightly underperforming the 0.6% drop in the CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the world's largest and most liquid cryptocurrencies.Read more: 'The Dow' for Crypto Markets? New CoinDesk 20 Index Underpins Futures Contracts at BullishBitcoin ETFs: Bust or not?The debate has now shifted to whether the bitcoin ETF launch was a success or a bust. For the ETF world in general, the new products have been a rousing success, argued Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas, noting $10 billion in trading volume for the new funds in their first three days. He said there were 500 ETF launches in 2023 and, combined, they did just $450 million in volume during the whole year.The bust crowd points to the lame price action since launch (bitcoin is lower by nearly 10%), the sizable proportion of selling action seen from GBTC and early net inflows that, while sizable, have fallen short of some bullish forecasts in the billions.\"Markets make opinions,\" said Richard Russell, the late editor of \"Dow Theory Letters.\" If prices remain flat to lower for much longer, the \"bust\" contingent will likely claim victory, but if bitcoin goes on to take out $50,000 this year and perhaps challenge its all-time high above $65,000, the ETFs will surely be thought of as a major success.Edited by Nick Baker."

LINK climbed after the company announced its cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP) integrated with Circle’s cross-chain transfer protocol on Tuesday. Bitcoin remained around the $42,700 mark. Other altcoins that saw significant gains included Render’s RNDR, which climbed 12%. Render is a platform that lets users contribute unused GPU power (A GPU, or graphics processing unit, is responsible for the digital rendering in a computer system) from their home devices to help projects render motion graphics and visual effects. Solana’s SOL was also up 5% over the same time period.While many contrarian bets about the price of bitcoin after the ETF approval have been proven right, Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer doesn’t expect the sell-off to continue much longer. In a thread on X, Timer, Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro, said current trends in bitcoin’s price are suggestive of a short-term positioning adjustment rather than a long-term trend reversal. While some have forecasted that bitcoin might drop and find support anywhere between the $32K to $38K mark, Timmer expects consolidation of recent gains. “The short-term question is whether this a sell-the-news moment. My guess is that it will take a little time to consolidate the recent gains, now that the big moment has arrived,” Timmer posted on X. \"There were more than a few participants who 'equitized' future spot positions through either the futures market or bitcoin-sensitive equities.\"Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, the parents of Sam Bankman-Fried, have asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit by the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX seeking to recover funds it alleges were fraudulently transferred. FTX sought to “recover millions of dollars” from Bankman and Fried in Sept. 2023. Less than two months later, their son, Bankman-Fried, was found guilty on all seven charges of defrauding customers and the U.S. His sentencing is expected in March. Bankman and Fried, both professors at Stanford Law School, argued that Bankman did not have a fiduciary relationship with FTX and did not serve “as a director, officer, or manager,” and even if a fiduciary relationship existed with FTX to plausibly allege a breach, according to a Jan 15. court filing.Chart of The DayThe chart shows trends in bitcoin and the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which gauges the greenback’s exchange rate against major fiat currencies.The DXY rose to a four-week high of 103.58 early Thursday, offering bearish cues to stocks and bitcoin.The cryptocurrency's Q4 rally coincided with the downtrend in the dollar.Source: TradingViewTrending PostsARK Buys $15.9M Worth of Its Own Bitcoin ETFBitcoin's ‘De-Dollarization’ Narrative Loses Ground As USD Tightens Its Grip on International TransactionsIndonesian Crypto Exchanges Blame Dramatic Drop in Trading Volumes Partly on High TaxesEdited by Parikshit Mishra."

However, data shows the dollar remained the most favored currency in international transactions, with global demand for U.S. government bonds holding steady.\"USD’s share in international SWIFT transactions surged in 2023 to reach its highest level in more than ten years. In contrast, the EUR share collapsed, and that of the JPY and GBP moderated,” Credit Agricole’s G10 FX strategy team said in a note to clients on Monday.“The growing importance of the USD as the currency of choice for international payments and transactions is another reason for global official and private investors to buy the currency. In turn, this should slow down further any push towards de-dollarisation,\" the strategists, led by Valentin Marinov, added.In other words, the dollar is likely to remain the currency of choice or haven asset during times of stress, sucking money from other assets like bitcoin and stocks.The note said the USD’s share in foreign exchange reserves maintained by central banks worldwide held steady at 59% in 2023, the same level as the previous three years, citing data tracked by the International Monetary Fund's data. The euro's share dipped to its second lowest since 2017.Concerning trends in foreign investment in U.S. Treasury bonds (USTs), the note said that non-Asian nations compensated for the decline in China, Hong Kong, and Japan’s holdings in 2023, keeping the global tally steady.“We continue to think that expectations of aggressive unwinding of USD holdings are quite premature. Indeed, we note that whereas the UST holdings of China and Hong Kong (and to a lesser degree Japan) have been on a downtrend throughout 2023, demand for USTs from the rest of the world held up reasonably well,” Credit Agricole said. “In addition, it is worth highlighting that the UST holdings of Ireland and Belgium that are seen as proxies for custodial holdings of foreign investors like China have held up reasonably well as well.”Per Global Times, China’s stockpile of U.S. Treasury bonds totaled $769.6 billion in October, marking a seventh consecutive monthly drop and a decline of $97.5 billion in ten months of the year. The continued unwinding of China’s Treasury holdings fueled the de-dollarization narrative.Per Credit Agricole, the decline in Treasury holdings of some nations correlated with the fall of their respected foreign exchange reserves. Nations like China have long been parking reserves earned through trade surpluses in U.S. Treasury bonds, underwriting American consumption.Read more: Bitcoin Unlikely to Replace U.S. Dollar as Global Reserve: Marc ChandlerEdited by Parikshit Mishra."

The phrase and its counterpart, \"the death cross,\" in which the short-duration SMA dips below the long-duration SMA, originated in Japan, per some technical analysis textbooks.Many traders see crossovers as forward-looking indicators, with the golden version signaling a long-term bull market ahead.The bullish interpretation could be challenged because averages are based on past data and tends to lag prices. In other words, averages represent what happened in the past, and the first golden cross on the weekly chart results from bitcoin rallying over 70% to $42,700 in four months.Thus, seasoned traders consider crossovers as lagging indicators, often coinciding with trend exhaustion. For instance, the weekly death cross confirmed in early 2023 marked the bottom of the bear market. Bitcoin's daily chart golden and death crossovers have a mixed record of predicting bullish and bearish trends.Bitcoin's rally has already stalled, with the cryptocurrency trading 10% lower from highs near $49,000 registered after 11 spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) began trading in the U.S. last Thursday.Per observers, the bullish momentum has waned due to early ETF flows failing to match the sky-high market expectations.\"The Net flow of funds for the ETFs has been $965M (including seed funds), a strong start thus far.

Unicorn is a term used to describe private companies with a valuation of $1 billion or more.Crypto issuer Circle saw a surge in remittances flow through Asia via its USDC stablecoin, the company said in a new report highlighting how the cryptocurrency is used beyond speculative trading. USDC is a cryptocurrency pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, and backed by liquid cash and cash-equivalent assets. In 2022, $130 billion worth of USDC flowed into Asia, the report says. According to Circle, the Asia-Pacific region accounts for 29% of all global digital currency value received compared to 19% for North America, and 22% for Western Europe. These volumes are also made up of remittance transfers, a big deal for emerging markets with a large diaspora, such as the Philippines.

For the first time in a long time, the bitcoin markets will have a predictable and long-lasting arbitrage opportunity,” Hayes said.“Hopefully, billions of dollars of flow will be concentrated in an hour-long period on exchanges that are less liquid and price followers of their larger Eastern competitors. I expect there to be juicy spot arbitrage opportunities available,” he added.Hayes expects spot ETF products to pop up in major Asian markets, such as Hong Kong, which service “China southbound flow.” The presence of these highly regulated bourses and native crypto exchanges can create more market inefficiencies and thus profit opportunities, he said.ETF-based financing could be another sector poised for growth as bitcoin trading becomes commonplace in the coming years. Banks could open up desks that provide fiat loans against bitcoin ETF holdings, pocketing the spread and influencing bitcoin interest rates, further creating market imbalances.Meanwhile, Hayes said earlier in January that he is bearish on bitcoin in the short term and expects prices to undergo a 30% correction. It’s a sentiment shared by several other traders, who expect prices to fall as low as $38,000 before the next leg up.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "Now that spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are live in the U.S., market watchers are looking for the next potentially bullish event to drive cryptocurrency gains. Following the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) long-awaited decision to approve these financial products, bitcoin ETFs have simultaneously overperformed and underwhelmed expectations – representing the pluses and minuses of a market driven by hype.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteThe top three bitcoin ETFs have seen well over half a billion dollars worth of capital inflows (not counting Grayscale’s $22 billion fund, which was converted over from the existing GBTC trust and has seen sizable outflows), signifying the significant customer demand for traditional on-ramps into bitcoin (BTC). In the weeks leading up to the date of approval, Wednesday, Jan. 10, bitcoin rallied to a recent high of ~$48,000.Many analysts and traders are now hoping the upcoming bitcoin halving — when the rate of new bitcoins issued to network validators (aka miners) is slashed — could be a similar catalyst for crypto prices. There is a longstanding debate whether these programmatically triggered events that occur once every four years are “priced in.”The approval of bitcoin ETF’s last week may give some indication of what’s to come for the next bitcoin hype cycle. The listing of 11 new bitcoin funds was a clear moment to sell, at least in hindsight, and bitcoin has since sagged ~12% to $42,250 today. It remains too early to say whether bitcoin ETFs will draw in billions of new dollars and investors, a prediction that hangs on actual demand for bitcoin.See also: Bitcoin Traders Eye Support at $40K as ETF Contrarian Bets Prove RightMeanwhile, the bitcoin halving (sometimes halvening) narrative is a supply-side story: bitcoin’s price could pop after the supply of new coins entering the market becomes constrained, assuming use of the Bitcoin network remains steady or increases.To some extent, the bitcoin halving narrative is a post-hoc rationalization for the fact that bitcoin has in fact gone on a tear in the months after every halving so far. For instance, six months after the network’s second halving in 2016 (when the emissions of new coins per block fell from 25 to 12.5 BTC), bitcoin crossed the $1,000 threshold for the first time. A similar rally happened in 2020, when bitcoin set a new all-time high.But there’s little to suggest that these price increases are directly related to the halving, outside of the increased bullish sentiment and media coverage that typically precedes the event. CoinShares, in its latest “Mining Report” noted that there’s a “peak in hashrate growth often occurs about four months before the halving, likely due to a ‘Bitcoin rush,’” which could represent positive sentiment.Except the economic logic around a bitcoin supply shock is a bit shaky, considering that the supply of new bitcoins will actually continue to increase for the next century or so, at which point all 21 million bitcoins will have been mined. Satoshi Nakamoto designed the Bitcoin network to subsidize miners through these rewards to stimulate adoption, hoping that over time transaction fees will grow large enough to sustain network security and validation.CoinShares doesn’t offer a price prediction in its report, which instead makes the case that bitcoin mining will grow more competitive after the halving, knocking out the least efficient miners. While Bitcoin has become 90% more efficient since the last halving, hashrate (which represents the amount of computing power put towards network security) and cost structures have also increased.In fact, the current bitcoin mining difficulty is at historic highs, with computing power jumping over 100% in 2023. CoinShares predicts this to fall off after the halving with a “miner exodus.” The company also said the “average cost of production per coin” could normalize at just under $38,000 post-halving, given the complicated interrelation between hardware and electricity costs, difficulty levels and the cost structures that determine whether certain miners are making or losing money, which determines how many miners are on the network.What exactly does this mean for bitcoin price predictions? Well somewhat contradictorily, if bitcoin prices remain above $40,000 it may actually drive miner returns lower. CoinShares doesn’t offer this prediction as such, but given that miners are often the largest sellers of bitcoin, reduced profitability may also create selling pressure from that group.See also: Bitcoin Miner Outflows Hit Six-Year Highs Ahead of HalvingThere are plenty of others who disagree, and see the halving as another potential positive catalyst for bitcoin prices. But it’s important to note that everyone has their own incentives. The only near-guarantee when it comes to the halving is that it’s another moment for hype.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

For long-term holders, the fee emissions will bleed a position substantially. It may take many years, but we expect demand for ETFs to dwindle as bitcoin adoption rises and self-custody becomes more common among institutions,” Robinson added.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

The curve is normally upward-sloping, with longer-duration bonds offering higher yields than shorter-duration bonds. In mid-2022, the curve inverted, with the two-year yield rising above the 10-year yield. The spread between the 10- and two-year yields dropped as low as -100 basis points in July 2023 before beginning the recovery, often called de-inversion or normalization.The normalization has gathered pace this month, with the spread rising from -38 basis points to -0.20, primarily due to bull steepening or the two-year yield falling more than the ten-year yield. The two-year yield has declined by 10 basis points to 4.14% this month, thanks to expectations for the Fed rate cuts, while the 10-year yield has risen by eight basis points to 3.94%.Historically, bull steepeners have been followed by recessions, according to pseudonymous observer The Spread Thread. Investment management firm Lord Abbett said the same in a blog post in October last year.In other words, the ongoing bull steepening might be a sign of an impending recession.A drop in consumer and business confidence seen during recessions can result in less demand for assets like bitcoin and technology stocks, although a potential monetary easing by the Federal Reserve to counter the recession and the resulting slide in the dollar index could eventually prove bullish for bitcoin, as it did during the coronavirus-induced recession of 2020.The vertical shaded lines represent U.S. recessions.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

The company got the all clear from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday to convert the fund into a spot bitcoin exchange traded-fund (ETF), which began trading Thursday alongside 10 other ETFs. The fund had been trading at a discount to the price of the bitcoin it held, hitting a record low of nearly 50% in December 2022. GBTC’s discount to NAV began to narrow significantly as the expectations of an ETF approval surfaced several months ago along with rising bitcoin sentiment.Franklin Templeton reduced the fee on its bitcoin (BTC) ETF to 0.19% of net assets, becoming the cheapest amongst the new investment products. San Mateo, California-headquartered Franklin Templeton has reduced the fee for its Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) from 0.29%, according to a filing with the (SEC) on Friday. The 10 basis-point reduction makes the fund's fee the lowest, beating Bitwise's 0.2%.

The conditions, according to the person close to UBS who asked to not be named, include: UBS cannot solicit the trades and accounts with a lower risk tolerance won't be able to buy them.

The highly-anticipated investment products came into effect after years of wait as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved them on Wednesday.While several things happened in the weeks leading up to their debut, some related to implied volatility and the options market are worth noting as speculators look at ether (ETH) as the next likely candidate for a spot ETF approval.Implied volatility represents investors' expectations of price turbulence and positively impacts the prices of call and put options. A call allows buyers to profit from or hedge against price rallies, while a put offers protection against price slides.When facing a binary event such as the earning’s date in a stock or the SEC’s decision on spot ETF applications, traders tend to buy options to build a “long vega” position that benefits from increases in implied volatility. The strategy, however, exposes traders to a potential post-event crash in volatility and the resulting slide in options prices.That’s precisely what happened in the bitcoin market, a lesson for ether traders that holding a long volatility exposure on the day of the ETF announcement may be risky, according to crypto quant researcher Samneet Chepal.\"It’s a sea of red for vols right now. Something to remember with the ETH ETF story unfolding. Price action usually ramps up well before the big day, but volatility often spikes just as the event draws closer. By the time of the actual announcement, being net long vol might not be ideal,” crypto quant researcher Samneet Chepal said on X.“For the ETH ETF, considering a short vega (vol) position could be viable as we’ve been down this road with the BTC ETF, giving us a bit of insight into what might be coming up,” Chepal added.The seven-day IV has crashed since the SEC's approval of spot ETFs. (Amberdata) (Amberdata)While bitcoin’s price began rallying on ETF optimism in early October, the annualized seven-day implied volatility kicked into high gear this month, reaching 96% ahead of the SEC’s approval. But since then, it has collapsed to 52%.Focus on options pricingBitcoin rallied over 60% in the three months leading up to the ETF launch. Still, the consensus view early this week dismissed the possibility of a sell-the-fact pullback following the Jan. 10 launch, calling an unabated rally.Options, however, warned of a post-approval cooling period. Early this week, bitcoin puts began trading at a premium to calls, in a sign of sophisticated market participants seeking protection against price drops.Bitcoin rose from $46,000 to above $49,000 after the spot ETFs began trading Thursday. However, the pop was short-lived, and prices have retreated to nearly $46,000 since then.Therefore, traders may want to keep track of how ether options are priced as they speculate on the potential launch of an ether spot ETF.Several firms have filed applications for spot ether ETFs, including BlackRock, in November 2023. The earliest deadline for approvals is in May for VanEck’s ETF, followed by BlackRock’s in August.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

She requested: \"If you quote any of the following, I ask that you use the statements in full and with context.\"Typically we don't have space to include such responses in their entirety, and we also try to distill information for the benefit or our readers.In this case, we're making an exception – because the matter goes right to the heart of the governance of the Bitcoin blockchain and the thrust of the main question raised in our original article: Who gets to decide which transactions are appropriate for the $900 billion blockchain, and which ones aren't?It's the kind of existential question that all the new investors in bitcoin ETFs might need to ground themselves in at some point.Below are Chow's verbatim responses to our questions regarding her decision to close the proposal, technically known as a \"pull request\" or PR:We were wondering if you had any comments on why you closed the pull request?Chow: As I said in the comment I left when closing the PR, it was obviously controversial and had no hope of reaching a conclusion acceptable to everyone. PRs that are unlikely to achieve (rough) consensus for merging should be closed.The PR was additionally locked since all it was doing was generating noise. Bitcoin Core uses GitHub for code collaboration and it is essentially the developers' place of work. When someone makes a bold claim on twitter that angers people, and then encourages them to leave comments on GitHub, they end up disrupting the developers. These comments often contain accusations of bad faith, poorly informed statements about the code, and demands for the developers to make major changes, which drag the developers into arguments in order to defend themselves and correct misconceptions. Since there are commenters in favor of both sides, there were also discussions amongst them that did not involve the developers at all, but still sent a notification to everyone. Overall, this has a negative effect on productivity, results in a more toxic environment, and drives away developers from their place of work.Was this a decision you took independently or did it follow discussions behind the scenes with other Bitcoin Core contributors/maintainers?Chow: The decision to close it at that time was made independently by myself. It was done after reading review comments from several long time contributors that NACK'd the PR and also suggested that it should be closed. These review comments provided technical criticisms that generally concluded that the PR in its current state was not [a] good idea and was potentially harmful.We were curious if you have received any backlash and/or comments behind the scenes following the decision to close that PR?Chow: Yes. As with any other controversial PR, there are two camps within the wider Bitcoin community – one for merging and one against. Any action taken with the PR will of course result in both camps expressing their feelings on that action. This is expected.Dashjr has asserted that the PR was “inappropriately” closed – curious if you might have a comment on that?Chow: Since I closed the original PR, I do not believe that it was inappropriately closed. Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.Edited by Marc Hochstein."

        "content": "As the first batch of spot bitcoin ETFs starts trading, crypto advocates grapple with its implications.While some view crypto's linking up with traditional finance as a positive and inevitable part of going mainstream, others worry it spells bad news for the promise of decentralization.It's official. The U.S. securities watchdog on Wednesday made history by begrudgingly approving a batch of bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETF), energizing markets that were for months trembling with anticipation.These hard-won approvals are largely viewed as a leg-up for an industry hoping to rebuild its reputation after 2022's spectacular market collapse fueled by Sam Bankman-Fried and others. But for long-time crypto advocates, considerations may go beyond market recovery.Some fear that fraternizing with crypto's original enemy – traditional finance (TradFi), Big Banks and Wall Street, which early fans of the Bitcoin blockchain had in their sights – threatens to break its original promise of decentralizing financial services. Others contend that bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency, was intended for the masses, and that some form of alignment with TradFi was unavoidable – with benefits to both parties.\"It was always an inevitable part of the process of going mainstream,\" Jameson Lopp, software engineer and bitcoin advocate, said during an interview, speaking about crypto and TradFi colliding through the creation of bitcoin ETFs. \"Wall Street wants a cut of the action.\"However, these bitcoin ETFs will \"accelerate the flywheel of adoption\" and make the asset class \"less of a scary concept\" to mainstream audiences, he added.Read more: On Bitcoin White Paper's 15th Anniversary, Wall Street Threatens to Swallow Its One-Time ChallengerSpot ETFs allow investors to take advantage of the popular cryptocurrency's volatile price movement sans the hassle of having to learn about strange-sounding concepts like self-custody, blockchain and private keys.Erik Voorhees, one of crypto's earliest entrepreneurs, said on social media platform X that the \"most important result\" of bitcoin ETFs would be dissuading governments from treating the crypto harshly.\"When 50 million boomers own [bitcoin] passively, the political and economic damage from a ban will be significantly less palatable. It's no longer just an asset for shadowy super coders,\" Voorhees said. \"And it's absolutely a Trojan Horse about to be pulled through gates of Troy.\"Threat of corruptionIf Satoshi Nakamoto releasing the Bitcoin white paper 15 years ago was an almighty act of rebellion against TradFi – like the Greek god Zeus fighting his titan father Cronus to avoid being eaten up like his siblings – then bitcoin was supposed to be the people's weapon against the unchecked power of big banks, whose irresponsibility and greed brought the global economy to its knees in 2008.It's unsurprising, then, that to some purists on both sides, the ETF approvals not only represent the convergence of two worlds designed to be rivals, but the potential corruption of both.\"The approval of bitcoin ETFs will inevitably turn out to be a very bad thing for Bitcoin decentralization,\" said Proof of Decentralization podcast host Chris Blec on X.While ETFs will see new institutional and retail money flowing into crypto, Nicky Gomez, senior partner at XReg Consulting, warns they will also influence more centralization moving bitcoin \"further away from its true value and potential.\"\"Ultimately, this will spur a larger divide with the crypto purists,\" Gomez said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.On the TradFi side, economic security nonprofit Better Markets criticized the SEC approvals on X, saying bitcoin and crypto \"remain the preferred product of speculators, gamblers, predators and criminals.\"SEC commissioner Caroline Crenshaw called the development \"unsound and ahistoric\" in a Wednesday statement.Though he doesn't think bitcoin ETFs are good or bad for crypto, Lopp hopes huge fund inflows and mainstream interest won't change the protocols of networks like Bitcoin.\"Hopefully, the ETF issuers won't care much about the properties of the protocol because they won't actually be interacting with it – their custodians will handle all the heavy lifting,\" Lopp said.As for whether ETFs will work against the idea of self-custody championed by crypto, Lopp said keeping control of one's assets was always an optional thing.\"If someone prefers the convenience of an ETF over holding the actual asset, that's their choice. One could make similar arguments with regard to any commodity that is traded via ETFs. Few folks want to take custody of barrels of oil, for example,\" he said.A case for the inevitableLike Lopp, CoinDesk columnist and equity researcher J.P. Koning makes a case that crypto mingling with TradFi was inevitable.\"Since bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, adoption has always relied on close integration with traditional finance, so a bitcoin ETF is nothing new, really; it represents just one more upgrade of the very old linkage between the two,\" Koning said.A rather straightforward view would be that, at the end of the day, it all comes down to price.\"I don't see bitcoin ETFs as clashing with what original proponents of crypto hoped for, because from the very start even the most idealistic strains of bitcoinism were always twinned with the raw desire to make money,\" Koning said. \"For the number to go up, more funds must be drawn in, which requires not only relying on the linkages already forged to traditional finance, like the integration with the card networks, but new forms of interconnection.\"\"After the ETF has begun to trade, the bitcoin community will go on to pushing for the next big bond to TradFi, because that's what will drive the price even higher,\" he said.Edited by Nick Baker."

Whether that price trend will continue in the short term depends on \"the trajectory of other monetary policy, and whether we will not see more scandals,\" from the crypto space, Gusdorf said.Bitcoin's price experienced some volatility on Thursday, climbing as high as nearly $49,000 but falling to $46,000 within the space of about 90 minutes. However, the asset's price has more than doubled over the past year, according to CoinGecko.\"In the medium to long term, we see it as a positive development that will increase the price discovery and the stability of bitcoin. And it will probably increase the allocation of some institutional investors to this asset class,\" Ventricelli said.Moody’s doesn’t rate bitcoin and can’t really comment on whether it’s a significant credit risk, but investing through traditional players like BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) were among the ETFs that started trading today, according to Gusdorf. But buyers can \"remove some of the risks that could be associated with a middleman that could have been probably less regulated before the SEC decision.\"He warned, however, that bitcoin remains a very volatile investment and that investors should keep this risk in mind when allocating funds from their portfolios.Crypto x TradFiETFs are also not the only way crypto is colliding with the world of traditional finance (TradFi). Gusdorf and Ventricelli said their team has been closely watching developments in the field of tokenization, where blockchain and distributed ledger technologies that power crypto are used for digitizing real assets be they bonds, funds or commodities.Central banks and big TradFi players have been experimenting with tokenization, with a few already offering tokenized green bonds and other funds.According to Marat Faritov, assistant vice president of the DFDA unit at Moody’s, the approval of bitcoin ETFs is also positive for other players in the crypto industry, from custody solutions providers to tokenizers.\"For example, now banks will start using those services to enable the solutions so probably will be generating more revenue for all these companies around the crypto space,\" Faritov said.According to Gusdorf, although crypto is \"increasingly less mentioned\" at conferences on tokenization, there has been a convergence between the TradFi and crypto spaces. Earlier this month, Gusdorf’s team rated a tokenized fund to be issued on the Ethereum and Stellar blockchains.\"So we are seeing a number of bridges being built between the crypto worlds and the TradFi world here,\" Gusdorf said.Edited by Nikhilesh De."

When bitcoin halving occurs, the rewards miners receive are cut by 50%.“With levered upside and theoretical hedged downside, we believe bitcoin miners represent an attractive investment opportunity for equity investors looking for a way to access this long-term bitcoin adoption trade,” the authors wrote, adding that the spot ETFs could have a “substantial positive impact on bitcoin miner valuations.”Investment bank H.C. Wainwright & Co. said spot ETF approval is a “historic moment for bitcoin and the miners,” as ETFs offer both retail and institutional investors a “familiar and regulated investment vehicle” and should significantly expand access to the world’s largest cryptocurrency.“We believe many BTC-curious institutional and retail investors have lacked either the willingness or the ability to directly invest in BTC, given the nuanced requirements to acquire digital assets,” analyst Mike Colonnese wrote. “We expect significant incremental demand for BTC via these newly approved spot ETFs.”Read more: Bitcoin Miners May Be Due a Breather After Spot ETF Approval, JPMorgan SaysEdited by Sheldon Reback."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesSpot bitcoin ETFs were finally approved in the U.S. after a decade of trying. The Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light Wednesday to key filings from the markets seeking to list the groundbreaking products. They will begin trading today. Bitcoin's price topped $47,500 following the decision and is now trading around $47,000. About a dozen companies, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, sought to create bitcoin ETFs. These are spot ETFs, meaning they hold bitcoin itself, versus the already-approved bitcoin futures ETFs, which hold derivatives contracts tied to BTC. The hotly anticipated products will debut on U.S. markets run by the NYSE, Cboe Global Markets and Nasdaq, aided by major trading firms who plan to provide liquidity.Grayscale, the manager of GBTC, claimed bragging rights as the first of the newly approved spot bitcoin ETFs to begin trading, a representative for the firm said on Thursday. “I am happy to confirm that GBTC started pre-trading at 4 am EST this morning,” Grayscale’s head of communications, Jennifer Rosenthal, said in an email. The conversion of Grayscale’s $27 billion bitcoin trust into an ETF was approved by the SEC on Wednesday, one of many applicants approved by the U.S. markets regulator.The spot bitcoin ETF approvals also buoyed ether (ETH) traders, who are betting the token that powers the Ethereum network could be next in line. The ETH price has jumped 10% in 24 hours, while bitcoin added 1.3%. Tokens of layer 2 networks, which operate as individual blockchains but are ultimately built atop Ethereum, surged as well. Arbitrum’s ARB and Mantle’s MNT both gained more than 20%. Other Ethereum ecosystem tokens, ranging from meme coins to those that power Ethereum-based applications, rose 14% on average, the category tracked by CoinGecko shows. “The largest smart money inflows” were directed toward the Ethereum ecosystem in the past 24 hours, Nansen analyst Martin Lee said in a Telegram message. Nansen defines smart money as wallets that trade or invest in a way that is considered experienced or well informed and are usually profitable.Chart of the DayThe chart shows cumulative volume delta in futures tied to ether.Crypto exchange OKX is leading the growth in the CVD followed by Binance to indicate net capital inflows into the market.Ether has surged nearly 10% to $2,650 in the past 24 hours, as traders see the second-largest cryptocurrency as a favourite candidate for a spot ETF approval following bitcoin.Source: Velo Data- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsGary Gensler Voted to Approve Bitcoin ETFs, Despite Public CriticismBitcoin ETF Approval Is Likely to Benefit Institutional Investors: Goldman SachsBitcoin ETFs: What to Expect on Day OneEdited by Sheldon Reback."

Commissioners Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Lizárraga voted against the plans.While Peirce is a known backer of the cryptocurrency industry, Gensler has remained publicly dismissive and skeptical of the market, citing customer protection and fraud as key risks that plague the industry.Gensler’s first comments after the Wednesday approvals reinforced the SEC’s negative stance on bitcoin, stating that the regulator’s loss in court over rejecting Grayscale’s in 2022 left it with no option but to approve over 12 bitcoin ETFs.“We did not approve or endorse bitcoin,” Gensler said. “Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.”In another statement, Crenshaw, who disapproved of the filings, said the decision put “us on a wayward path that could further sacrifice investor protection.”Approved providers include financial giants BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity, while crypto native fund Grayscale’s popular Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has been uplisted as an ETF as well. Fees on these products range from zero for the first few months (at ARK, Bitwise and Invesco) to as much as 1.5% (at Grayscale).Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Fees on these products range from zero for the first few months (at ARK, Bitwise and Invesco) to as much as 1.5% (at Grayscale).Finney, who died in August 2014, was also the first person besides Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, to download and run Bitcoin software.He also believed that bitcoin could grow very quickly. In an email sent to Nakamoto, Finney was one of the first to put a price on the token. Estimating a fraction of total global household wealth would spill into the project, and one day each of the 21 million coins could be worth $10 million.While bitcoin was originally supposed to be an anti-establishment play that operated far from traditional banking circles, its adoption on Wall Street means that the token is now positioned for widespread growth as an alternative asset.A regulated product will allow investors and funds to gain exposure to the token without the risks associated with setting up and managing a cryptocurrency wallet. As such, the green light from the SEC follows many years of delays and outright rejections of numerous attempts to launch spot bitcoin ETFs.Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of crypto exchange Gemini, filed their first application with the SEC to create a spot bitcoin ETF in 2013, which was promptly rejected then. Grayscale has tried to convert its trust to an ETF since 2017.Meanwhile, bitcoin prices hit as high as $47,500 early Thursday before retreating after the approvals, inching closer to their 2021 lifetime peak of $69,000.And while Finney isn’t around to see the apparent success of the magic internet money – his legacy will forever live on.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

That decision opened the floodgates, with a number of competing applications soon following.Bitcoin gained over 160% since that moment, based on the idea that if the SEC approved bitcoin ETFs, any number of retail investors and companies would choose to invest in bitcoin. Standard Chartered predicted that upwards of $100 billion could flow into bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. this year.All of this remains to be seen, but now, with the SEC’s decision to approve 11 of the 13 bitcoin ETF applications, the world will.

This was evident when PayPal launched the ability to buy certain cryptocurrencies, and some banks started offering crypto custody.

This ETF approval has the potential to not only accelerate market adoption but also to foster lasting momentum within the industry. As we move forward with more ETF applications, it is essential for ETF providers to collaborate with qualified custodians who have a proven track record in safeguarding digital assets like BTC. This collaborative approach is crucial in reducing risks and creating a secure environment for investors.\"Kristin Smith, CEO, Blockchain Association: \"The approval of a Bitcoin ETF adds more pressure on Congress to pass fit-for-purpose legislation for the digital asset ecosystem.

The Gold Market Provides a $100 Billion AnswerJames Angel, associate professor, Georgetown University: \"If the SEC is anti-crypto, they have shot themselves in the head. If they had just quietly approved the Grayscale [ETF application] all those many years ago, there would be a few crypto ETFs out there without much fanfare. By delaying as long as they have, they are creating a lot more free publicity for crypto. Also, they appear to be consciously setting it up so that multiple ETFs will start trading at the same time. Whatever the reason, they are invoking the marketing might of the biggest behemoths on Wall Street to start peddling these ETFs. Expect to see lots of advertising pushing various crypto products. If the SEC doesn't want Mr. and Mrs. Main St to invest their IRAs in crypto, the SEC chose exactly the wrong approach.\"Cami Russo, founder of The Defiant: \"It's great that an ETF makes holding Bitcoin easier for institutions, but ultimately we're packaging bitcoin in a fund, so that intermediaries can sell them to investors, when crypto should be about pushing investors in the opposite direction, and getting them comfortable with non custodial and permission-less solutions.\"Anil Lulla, CEO, Delphi Digital: \"Now the process will be straightforward to buy Bitcoin for retirement accounts with much lower fees. Today is the last day ever where the only people incentivized to shill $BTC and crypto are us in the community. Tomorrow, all these ETF issuers will have teams of people incentivized to call our parents/grandparents up to talk about Bitcoin. And the competition will be fierce. Especially in this first year, once a frontrunner is obvious, it will continue to get an outsized portion of inflows into these ETFs. Because of this, the fees will be a race to near zero. You've already seen this start to happen.\"Molly White, author of the Citation Needed newsletter: \"Even the bitcoin ETFs are approved and it fails to have significant price impact, I think we will still all be able to celebrate bitcoin achieving an important milestone towards its original goals. Finally, people will be able to turn their money into an anonymous peer-to peer asset outside of government control, to which they own their own keys and thus control completely, without having to involve powerful financial institutions like BlackRock.\"Cory Klippsten, CEO, Swan Bitcoin: \"The top-of-funnel for Bitcoin is now represented by the most established and trusted Wall Street institutions which will proceed to spend hundreds of millions of dollars extolling the virtues of Bitcoin, and only Bitcoin.

Such an ETF could lead to increased demand for bitcoin, and enhance both price discovery and market liquidity. However, this development also brings certain risks. The notorious price volatility of bitcoin, as well as its fluctuating values against stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, could expose mainstream investors to a less familiar spectrum of investment risks.\"Cynthia Lo Bessette, head of digital asset management at Fidelity: \"We’ve long believed a spot-priced exchange traded-product would be an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin. Fidelity has engaged in constructive dialogue with the SEC for years, and the affirmation of this approval signals positive momentum for the industry, and increased choice for investors who want to engage with digital assets. As a firm, we remain committed to meeting the growing demand from investors by providing them with tools that support their choices and facilitate secure access to markets.\"Andrew Rossow, attorney and CEO of AR Media: \"This level of confidence in a bitcoin ETF being approved isn’t something to take lightly, because of the high-level demand that the market has been begging for in establishing some initial regulatory framework with respect to digital assets and modern day securities law. The frustration with the SEC’s internal infrastructure and understanding of this emerging digital finance sector has only been met with short-sightedness, leaving not just the SEC on autopilot, but also leaves consumers, financial institutions and retail investors, and now regulators vulnerable to exploits that only serve to hinder market growth and cap the expansion rate with these emerging markets and technologies in our digital age.\"Whether SEC Chair Gary Gensler likes it or not, the system must change with respect to securities laws, because the domestic and international markets have changed (and are actively adapting). The SEC can no longer hide behind its fear of market manipulation, an irony in which the SEC has actually been manipulating the market by resisting natural progression. As we saw today, this market will always try to self-correct, even if it comes in the form of mundane black hat cyber attacks.\"Samuel Armes, founder, Florida Blockchain Association: \"I think at the end of the day, these ETFs are going to bring a bunch of money into the space. It's going to make the price go up. It's going to make more people involved. But, I also think it's going to start the division between actually being able to hold your keys and having, you know, synthetic bitcoin. So, I think most people will opt to just buy and hold the ETF. I think a lot of boomers in the older generation will never self custody their bitcoin, which is obviously antithetical to the mission [of the token], but they just want to get involved in it now [that bitcoin is back]. So, the base layer mission of Bitcoin of sovereign independence and freedom money will take a hit. But, the price is still coming to work, and adoption — quote-on-quote — will go up as well, whatever that means.\"Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder, Anchorage Digital: \"A spot bitcoin ETF marks the end of crypto as a \"novel\" asset class — and the beginning of a world where it can be part of every portfolio.

For 15 years, bitcoin has been growing in prominence as an asset class amongst retail investors, while in a reversal of traditional roles, institutional investors have remained largely on the sidelines waiting for traditional finance rails to be put in place.“Today’s news provides an answer for institutional demand for bitcoin. It’s good news for crypto markets and supportive of our belief that bitcoin is an unstoppable technology. It is digital gold and taking a long term view, I believe that it represents the intersection of finance, economics and technology.“For our users, retail investors, today’s news is positive as it will be supportive of the growth of bitcoin as an asset class, but I believe that the majority of ordinary investors will want to continue to buy and hold real BTC.”See also: Gary Gensler's Statement on Bitcoin ETF ApprovalsTroy Cross professor of philosophy at Reed College and a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute: \"Larry Fink is Constantine, meaning the emperor who converts to Christianity, changing both the empire and the religion forever.

According to the website mempool.space, which tracks activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, the fee paid was $2.97.The SEC has been at the center of intense speculation not only because of the regulator's longstanding opposition to a spot Bitcoin ETF, but also a hack on Tuesday of its official Twitter account that led to a fake posting of an approval announcement, roiling crypto markets.The choice of wording for Tuesday's Bitcoin transaction stunt recalls the message purportedly embedded into the blockchain's original \"Genesis\" block in 2009, a headline from British newspaper The Times that read: \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\"Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."

LDO, the governance token of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind liquid-staking system Lido, gained over 20% while the ARB token of Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum rose almost 17%. Bitcoin fell 2.2%. BlackRock has filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its iShares Ethereum Trust, a spot ether ETF.With the crypto industry anticipating the SEC approving a spot bitcoin ETF as early as today, BlackRock (BLK) and ARK 21Shares both cut the fees for their proposed ETFs, joining rivals who announced reductions yesterday. BlackRock said it will charge 25 basis points on net asset value in a new S-1 filing on Wednesday, having previously revealed a fee of 30 basis points on Monday. The asset-management giant is offering a promotional rate of 12 basis points on the first $5 billion during the first 12 months after listing. ARK 21Shares reduced the fee by 4 basis points to 0.21%, having previously said it would charge 0.25%. The firms are waiving the fee entirely for the first six months or the first $1 billion in assets, whichever comes first.Price volatility following a series of fake tweets from the SEC’s X account caused nearly $90 million worth of bitcoin long and short positions to be liquidated, showcasing manipulation risks associated with the industry. Hackers caught hold of the SEC’s X account on Tuesday, using it to post a nod for the much-awaited bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval decision. It later posted “$BTC,” before both tweets were promptly deleted. Those tweets caused the bitcoin price to immediately spike to $47,680 from the $46,800 level. It then fell as low as $45,400 as the tweets were found to be fake.Chart of the DayThe chart shows the dollar value of assets managed by ProShares' bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund, which trades on the NYSE under the ticker BITO.The AUM rose to a record $2 billion on Tuesday.The spot ETF narrative seems to have galvanized investor interest in exchange-traded products tied to BTC.Source: Ycharts- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsBrevan Howard, Hamilton Lane Back New Tokenization Platform LibreBTC Supply in Profit Nears 90% as Price Rallies on Expected Bitcoin ETF ApprovalCrypto OTC Volumes on Wintermute Soared 400% in 2023Edited by Sheldon Reback."

That's up from just under 50% at the start of last year.(CryptoQuant)Bitcoin rallied almost 160% in 2023 and has gained 50% in the last six months, largely in anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving an ETF. The price surge took many HODLers – slang for long-term investors – into the black.El Salvador, for instance, recently reported a $13 million profit on its bitcoin investment thanks to the rally.For full coverage of bitcoin ETFs, click here.However, CryptoQuant analysts warned in a recent report that high unrealized profits amongst bitcoin holders raise the risks of a sharp price decline. That's even as rising demand for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has applied for approval to convert to an ETF, narrowing discounts between the GBTC share price and its net asset value, and increasing trading volumes indicate strong anticipation for the spot ETF approval.One scenario CryptoQuant lays out is if bitcoin reaches $48,500, the average unit price of those holding crypto for between 2-3 years, a market correction is likely to occur, with potential support levels at $34k and $30k, the research firm wrote in a post. A correction is often considered to be a decline of between 10% and 20%.CryptoQuant said that the next resistance point for bitcoin, using network valuation metrics known as the Metcalfe band, is at $55,000.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Some may be worried about a potential delay in approvals.The cryptocurrency has rallied over 60% since early October, largely on expectations the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will greenlight one or more spot ETFs in early 2024. “Buy the rumor, sell the fact,” an old Wall Street adage, represents the idea that traders tend to buy an asset in anticipation of positive news, eventually closing their positions once the news is confirmed.The so-called spot ETFs investing in bitcoin rather than its futures are widely expected to pave the way for mass adoption, boosting the cryptocurrency’s market valuation.“We look for $50 billion-$100 billion of inflows into bitcoin ETFs in 2024, opening up the potential for BTC to reach the $200,000 level by the end of 2025,” Standard Chartered said in a note to clients on January 8.DVOL dropsDeribit’s forward-looking bitcoin volatility index (BTC DVOL), which calculates bitcoin’s annualized 30-day implied volatility or expectations for price turbulence over the next four weeks from options data, has declined ten points from 73% to 63% since Monday.Strijers said that traders have been selling calls and call spreads in January expiry contracts, driving the DVOL.Note that short-term implied volatility metrics like the seven-day gauge remain elevated above 100 or 50 points above the DVOL, signaling expectations for price turbulence in the immediate aftermath of the SEC decision.The DVOL has come off ten points since Monday.

It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).Such data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.A decision on thirteen proposed bitcoin ETFs is expected on Wednesday, with Bloomberg analysts placing approval odds at over 90% and crypto market bettors a relatively smaller 85%.Meanwhile, some crypto market participants criticized the SEC’s seemingly lax security measures to protect its account – even asking how the financial regulator could safeguard trillion-dollar markets if it couldn’t protect its social accounts.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Steady inflows into futures-based bitcoin ETFs such as ProShares' BITO, which holds BTC futures traded on CME, also contributed to the rise.For full coverage of bitcoin ETFs, click here.CME bitcoin futures open interest in BTC terms (K33 Research)As a sign of bullish sentiment, CME front-month futures contracts traded at a hefty premium of 18.7% annualized to the spot price, according to TradingView data.However, K33 Research forecasted in a Tuesday market report that this regime won't last, and both the open interest and premium will plummet if a spot-based bitcoin ETF gets approved in the U.S.The report pointed out that some 43% of the CME bitcoin futures contracts belonged to futures-based ETFs. As investors will likely rotate funds to cheaper spot ETFs, futures funds need to close their positions, pushing open interest and the premium lower.The other 57% of the contracts are held by active market participants, the report follows, whose exposure increased by 128% – to around 75,000 BTC from 33,000 – over the past three months. Holding these positions open is very expensive at the current premium, K33 noted, forecasting that some investors will seek to realize profits after the bitcoin ETF approval.\"All else equal, this structural rotation will lead to selling pressure,\" K33 analysts Anders Helseth and Vetle Lunde wrote. \"CME’s all-time high regime could rapidly approach an end.\"Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."

        "content": "One of the most controversial proposals to hit Bitcoin in years – a move that would have made it harder to mint NFTs and tokens atop the blockchain – has been abruptly terminated without any action being taken, leading to claims of censorship by the lead proponent for the change.The developer known publicly as Luke Dashjr, who has worked on Bitcoin for over a decade, created the proposal in September. The move came just months after the appearance of Ordinals, a protocol that allowed users to \"inscribe\" data onto the blockchain, such as NFTs or the specifications for new tokens. The Ordinals project quickly became so popular that it caused congestion on the network. The Bitcoin-based NFTs – previously only available on other blockchains, like Ethereum – have proven valuable in their own right, with a trio of \"BitcoinShrooms\" recently fetching about $450,000 in a sale at the historic auction house Sotheby's.Dashjr filed his proposal on the open-source developer platform Github under the very mundane and technical-sounding goal of updating the popular Bitcoin Core software \"to be effective with newer datacarrying styles.\" But the discussion quickly turned into an acrimonious debate over whether the 14-year-old blockchain should be preserved as a peer-to-peer payments network or if market forces should determine which transactions get prioritized.Even some experts who supported a more purist vision for the blockchain expressed skepticism that Dashjr's proposal to filter out the Ordinals transactions could win over Bitcoin miners, who play a key role in the network's operations and have benefited handsomely from the fee windfall.Read more: Ordinals Upend Bitcoin Mining, Pushing Transaction Fees Above Mining Reward for First Time in YearsA few days ago, Ava Chow, a Bitcoin Core maintainer, abruptly cut off further discussion of Dashjr's proposal – technically known as a \"pull request\" or PR – without taking any action to incorporate the fresh code.According to the web page for the open-source Bitcoin Core project, maintainers are responsible for adding code changes that \"the team agrees should be merged.\"\"It's abundantly clear that this PR is controversial and, in its current state, has no hope of reaching a conclusion that is acceptable to everyone,\" Chow wrote. \"At this point in time, I see no reason to leave this open and to continue to send notifications for the constant back-and-forth stalemate discussion.\"'Pretty sophisticated'Another Bitcoin Core maintainer, Gloria Zhao, tweeted out a summary of the debate on Github, including a recap of the technical details.The thrust of Dashjr's proposal was to apply strict data-size limits more broadly to Bitcoin transactions, similar to the hard 80-byte limit applied to a specific data field known as \"OP_RETURN.\"\"There's been a lot of talk about adding filters to keep Ordinals TXs out of bitcoin, and this is a pretty sophisticated way to do that,\" said Lisa Neigut, a Blockstream developer who also teaches courses for Bitcoin developers at Base58. \"It would basically make getting Ordinals into blocks very hard to do using the normal TX delivery pipeline.\"Zhao, in her summary, noted that the effort to \"Stop inscriptions\" as \"spam\" had been countered by arguments that \"We cannot write code to detect all embedded data.\"In response, Dashjr tweeted that \"you conveniently left out that the objections to the PR have already been refuted/answered,\" and that Chow had \"censored anyone who wants to reply.\"Read More: 'Bitcoin NFT' Hysteria Comes to Sotheby's as Super-Mario-Style Mushroom Character Tops $200KDashjr, who has been pushing to purge from Bitcoin what he once described as \"data storage schemes\" since at least 2014, made headlines recently when his firm Mummolin raised $6.2 million in a seed funding round led by Block Inc.'s head and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.Notably, leaders of the company's Ocean bitcoin mining pool signaled last month that the new project might filter out many transactions involving the Ordinals inscriptions.CoinDesk reached out to Dashjr for comment, and he responded by sending a link to a fresh post he wrote on Github a few days ago.The proposal to \"fix the bug\" was \"inappropriately closed due to social attacks,\" Dashjr wrote on Github. \"This remains an active issue that needs to be addressed.\"A slew of comments have already piled up on the new thread, starting a new debate on the topic.After publication of this article, Dashjr tweeted, \"Spam filtering isn't dead until the spam is dead.\"Read more: Bitcoin Inscriptions Divide BTC Community Amid Network Congestion, but Are 'Unstoppable'Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."

This means between 437,000 and 1.32 million new bitcoins would be held in U.S. ETFs by the end of 2024.If the inflows materialize as expected, bitcoin could rise to levels closer to $200,000 by the end of 2025, said the bank.Standard Chartered compared the potential bitcoin ETF to the first U.S.-based gold exchange-traded product, which launched in November 2004. Following this, the price of gold rose over 4x in the seven years it took for gold ETP holdings to mature.Bitcoin gained around 155% over the last year and is up 6% since the start of 2024, according to data from Messari.

McDonough thinks there will be approximately $1 billion worth of inflows by the end of the first quarter of this year.\"The obstacle of self custody has kept many investors out of the asset class, through approving a 40 Act structure that can give investors exposure in their traditional brokerage accounts, means the demographic of investors that can allocate even just 1% of their portfolio to this growing alternative asset class is exponential, and I think price activity (given the fixed supply of Bitcoin) will be just as big,\" McDonough said.Galaxy Digital predicted in an October report that ETFs would attract at least $14.4 billion of inflows in the first years of issuance. \"The inflows could ramp up by $27 billion by the second year and $39 billion by the third year,\" said the report.There are also a number of asset managers who have filed for spot ether ETFs with a final deadline for a decision in May. Standard Chartered said in the report that it expects the SEC to allow ether ETFs.Read more: What Happens to Bitcoin Price if Spot ETF Isn't Approved?Edited by Nikhilesh De."

The cryptocurrency has gained around 5% over the past 24 hours. While most market analysts say the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, some do not see this happening. Youwei Yang, the chief economist at BIT Mining, said in an email to CoinDesk that he thinks no spot bitcoin ETFs will be approved in the near future. Rather, Yang expects the SEC to delay approvals for at least another 3 months. “A delay with some reasons or excuses could still possibly occur, such as questioning of manipulative behaviors sometimes observed in the crypto market that are still unclear, and its criminal or terror activities some congress members claimed that crypto has involved,” Yang wrote. Other analysts think the news has already been priced in, Matteo Bottacini, a trader at Crypto Finance, said that most market participants have been well-positioned for some time now, limiting the upside potential.BlackRock (BLK) and VanEck, two of the 13 firms hoping to launch bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in the U.S., filed updated documents on Tuesday.

CoinDesk reported earlier that the SEC sent comments to a set of prospective issuers just hours after the companies filed documents detailing fees for their proposed products on Monday. Among the changes in the latest updated filing on Tuesday is wording that seeks to mitigate damage to shareholders in the event of insolvency and avoid a conflict of interest between the ETF’s authorized participants.The discount on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world’s largest bitcoin fund, slipped to the narrowest since April 2021 ahead of an expected conversion to a spot bitcoin ETF.

After last week's payout, the address held nearly 100 BTC worth $4.5 million.Notably, the transaction happened only two days after the 15 year anniversary of the Bitcoin network's start.

        "content": "In the universe of exchange-traded funds, size matters. And in the world of spot bitcoin ETFs, the giant is Grayscale Investments, which, if approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, would come out of the gate with more than $27 billion of assets under management (AUM) while other potential issuers are starting from scratch.For those who have not been following the bitcoin (BTC) ETF proposal process in detail, a dozen or so issuers appear to be on the verge of being simultaneously approved by the SEC. Grayscale stands out from the crowd with its trove of over 619,000 BTC, having started back in 2013 as an easy way for institutional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without holding the asset directly.For full coverage of bitcoin ETFs, click here.There are other determining factors, such as the fees these products will charge. But judging by Grayscale's proposed 1.5% fees for its proposed ETF uplift, which is about 100 basis points, or one percentage point, higher than the competition, the firm is banking on its volume and liquidity.\"We have a massive differentiator from any other product that is going to come on the market because we have over a million investors and hundreds of millions of dollars in trading volume on a daily basis, and that will continue when it is approved to be uplisted to the New York Stock Exchange,\" David LaValle, global head of ETFs at Grayscale Investments, said in an interview.On the subject of fees, it's not necessarily the case that investors will switch products to maintain the same exposure solely based on fees, choosing BlackRock or Fidelity's lower fee structures for a spot bitcoin ETF, for instance. Such a move is particularly unlikely when tax considerations are factored in.For example, a Grayscale investor with long-term capital gains in the 15% to 20% range would be looking at a long time horizon to make up that tax bill based on a saving in basis points. Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence focused on ETFs, agrees that tax is going to be a big consideration for many when it comes to Grayscale.\"The tax issue is benefiting Grayscale, in my opinion,\" Balchunas said in an interview. \"A lot of times with mutual funds, there are people who don't want to be in a certain active mutual fund that overcharges and underperforms, but the tax hit is so great after all these years in the bull market they just stay in there.\"That said, most market watchers believe Grayscale will see some degree of outflows, especially given that its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) traded at a large discount to the underlying value of bitcoin in recent times.\"There have been a number of people who have bought GBTC units betting that it will become an ETF,\" Sui Chung, CEO of crypto index provider CF Benchmarks, said in an interview. \"So they buy the discount, betting that once it becomes an ETF they can redeem at NAV [net asset value] and just hoover up that profit. It's hard to say how much AUM that will be, but it's likely to be a decent chunk.\"Certain esoteric factors can be added to this. Although it isn't Grayscale's fault, Chung said, one unknown factor is how much goodwill Grayscale has lost with investors through the years of big NAV discounts. Then there's the unfortunate circumstance of Grayscale's owner, Digital Currency Group, having legal woes. \"Although, in reality, GBTC is bankruptcy-remote, not every investor understands that. Some may just feel better going to BlackRock or Invesco,\" Chung said. (Another DCG division, Genesis, is restructuring in bankruptcy court.)Read more: Will Lawsuit Against DCG Impact GBTC’s Chances of an ETF Conversion?But the ETF industry is complex, and even if Grayscale were to quickly drop a few billion in assets, the fund would still have a huge upper hand, Bloomberg's Balchunas points out.\"GBTC opening on day one with over $20 billion and $350 million of daily volume is like bringing a gun to a knife fight,\" he said. \"Any of these products would kill to have that much money in like three years, let alone the first week. If Grayscale is able to convert on the first day, outside of BlackRock and Fidelity, it's gonna make it really exceptionally hard for the others.\"Although all the signs suggest Grayscale will be given a green light along with the other ETF hopefuls, the SEC could conceivably still try and prevent or delay them based on the regulator's stated goal of setting out a level playing field, Balchunas said.\"You have to remember that Grayscale embarrassed the SEC when they won their case,\" Balchunas said. \"I'm not saying the SEC is petty, but if they did want to get revenge, my guess is they could probably find some kind of a parking ticket reason to mess with them. But then they could get sued again. So it's complicated.\"Edited by Nick Baker and Aoyon Ashraf."

Perhaps rightfully so, as observers have long said an exchange-traded fund investing directly in BTC rather than futures tied to the cryptocurrency will unlock billions of dollars in investments from retail and institutional investors.Once that's out of the way, the next major event to watch out for could be the quarterly refinancing announcement (QRA) from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's department, due Jan. 29.With debt and deficits surging in the post-Covid world, the detailing of three-month borrowing needs and the size and duration of bond auctions have begun drawing more interest than usual.In August, the Treasury said it would boost sales for the first time in over two years while predicting further increases. Then, on Nov. 1, it said it planned to borrow $776 billion for the quarter, significantly less than expected, with slower sales of the 10-year Treasury note.The positive surprise saw the 10-year yield, or long-end rates, drop from the widely watched 5% level and end the year at 3.86%. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.U.S. 10-year debt is seen as one of the world's safest investments, and its interest rate is a global benchmark. The decline in the so-called risk-free rate likely incentivized risk-taking in financial markets, helping maintain demand for both bitcoin and stocks. (The ETF speculation catalyzed the rally, and supportive yield moves added to the momentum.)The upcoming announcement, however, might flag higher-than-expected borrowing and not be that helpful, according to Quinn Thompson, head of capital markets and growth at decentralized credit market Maple Finance.At the Nov. 1 announcement, the Treasury said it expected to borrow $816 billion in the first quarter, a record for the quarter, according to CNN.\"Coming down the pipe, we have the upcoming QRA from the Treasury set to be released on January 29th, [which] should not provide the same gleeful result for markets as last quarter's,\" Thompson wrote in the Jan. 7 edition of his newsletter. \"Long-end rates are now ~100 bps lower, and Yellen should be looking to take advantage of that by terming out some debt. This should be a headwind for USTs.\"Higher-than-expected borrowing with more sales of 10-year notes could put upward pressure on the benchmark yield, potentially slowing risk assets' ascent.At press time, bitcoin was trading at $43,780, with the 10-year yield at 4.01%.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Most Asian equity indices traded in the red, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng trading 2% lower amid a regulatory crackdown on gaming.The NFP data released Friday showed the U.S. economy created 216,000 jobs in December, beating expectations for 170,000 and above November’s downwardly revised 173,000. The jobless rate held steady at 3.7%, while average hourly earnings increased 4.1% year-on-year against a consensus estimate of 3.9%.Since the payrolls data, doubts have increased that the Fed will cut the Fed funds rate, the benchmark borrowing cost, as early as March. The CME Fed Watch tool shows traders now price a 60% chance of a rate cut in March, having fully baked in such a move in late December. The odds stood above 75% ahead of the payrolls report.Traders in the swap market now foresee roughly five 25 basis point rate cuts this year instead of six or seven similar-sized rate cuts priced before the payrolls data, per FT.The 10-year Treasury yield, the so-called risk-free rate, has risen by 15 basis points to 4.05% since Friday, also a sign of traders reassessing dovish Fed expectations or the possibility of the central bank delaying the rate cut. The benchmark yield fell by nearly 80 basis points to 3.86% in the final three months of 2023, offering a tailwind to risk assets, including bitcoin, thanks to expectations for aggressive Fed rate cuts and lesser-than-expected bond issuance by the U.S. Treasury.“The most intriguing aspect was the rise in wage gains, which stood at +4.1% year-over-year (Y/Y). This figure significantly exceeds the current inflation rates. Historically, wage-price spirals tend to be persistent elements of inflation psychology, which will likely compel the Fed to maintain flexibility in its policy decisions going forward,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in the weekly newsletter.A continued rise in yields presents downside risk to risk assets, although anticipation of the spot ETF launch in the U.S. may cushion bitcoin against adverse moves in the bond market.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is widely expected to approve one or more spot ETFs by Jan. 10. Per some analysts, the move has been priced in over the past three months, and the cryptocurrency could see a \"sell the fact” price drop following the approval.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

The decline could be as much as 40% if BTC rallies to $60,000-$70,000 in the coming weeks, he wrote.\"Bitcoin initially will decline sharply with the broader financial markets but will rebound before the Fed meeting,\" Hayes said. \"That is because bitcoin is the only neutral reserve hard currency that is not a liability of the banking system and is traded globally.\"Hayes joined a roster of crypto analysts who recently forecasted a correction for crypto markets.CryptoQuant said that a spot-based ETF approval would be a \"sell the news\" event and BTC could drop to $32,000, while K33 Research suggested reducing exposure as the market became overheated. Bitcoin is currently above $43,000.Matrixport head of research Markus Thielen warned about a bitcoin correction based on technical indicators with the SEC potentially putting off ETF decisions due to shortcomings in the filings. The report may have contributed to a near-10% decline in bitcoin's price earlier this week.Edited by Nick Baker."

        "content": "Opinions on what will happen in the crypto market if the SEC approves a spot bitcoin ETF are mixed.Some analysts say predictions of a huge influx of investment are overdone.This week marked the 15th year since the first block, the genesis block, was mined on the Bitcoin blockchain. For more than 10 of those years, industry stalwarts have pleaded with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), an instrument that's predicted to open the floodgates to a wave of institutional investment.So far, the SEC has rejected every application, but that may be about to change. Analysts are predicting that at least one of the more than a dozen current proposals will be approved as early as Friday.Read more: What Is a Bitcoin ETF?Opinions on what will happen in the crypto market if approval is granted are mixed.Gabor Gurbacs, the director of digital assets strategy at VanEck, said that while a spot ETF will create \"trillions in value\" over the long term, people tend to \"overestimate the initial impact of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs,\" and initial flows will equal only \"a few hundred million of (mostly recycled) money.\"For full coverage of bitcoin ETFs, click here.Other analysts say approval will require ETF issuers to purchase tens of billions dollars of bitcoin to satisfy the institutional demand, leading to a radical shift in the supply and demand dynamics. Some analysts even predict a \"supply shock\" after exchange balances fell to a five-year low in October. A lack of bitcoin on exchanges suggests holders are storing it in their personal wallets, a sign they're less inclined to sell.Analysis of flows into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), the first spot gold ETF in the U.S., which debuted in 2004, is informative. GLD amassed $1.9 billion in inflation-adjusted terms in its first four weeks, with the tally rising to $4.8 billion by the end of the first year, according to crypto exchange Coinbase. The ETF currently has $57.37 billion in total assets.Going back further in time, Invesco's QQQ, an ETF that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index of some of the world's most innovative companies, was launched in March 1999, a year before the dotcom bubble burst. The fund saw inflows of $847 million ($1.6 billion in today's dollars) in the first 30 days.Read more: Bitcoin ETF Fees Will Play Critical Role in the Race to PopularityAnd closer to home, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), based on bitcoin futures, amassed around $1.5 billion in inflation-adjusted terms in the 30 days after its introduction in October 2021, when sentiment across crypto asset classes was uber bullish. As of Thursday, the fund held $1.65 billion in total assets.BITO, which invests in regulated CME futures rather than actual cryptocurrency, is exposed to rollover costs. The fund has, nevertheless, closely tracked bitcoin's spot price since inception and been a viable option for people looking for exposure to bitcoin without the ownership and storage hassles.Another consideration is the global economy, with elevated risk-free interest rates worldwide and worsening household finances. That macroeconomic environment plays against a scenario of strong mainstream uptake for spot ETFs.How will the market react?Bitcoin has rallied 61% since early October, largely on expectations the SEC will approve one or more of the spot ETF applications. That's prompted several analysts to forecast a sell-the-news-led pullback once the ETFs go live. They say the price will drop as investors who'd benefited from the run-up sell to lock in their profits once the news is confirmed.Consider the debut of CME bitcoin futures in December 2017, Coinbase's listing on Nasdaq in mid-April 2021, and the debut of several futures ETFs, including BITO. On those occasions, bitcoin had been rallying only to crash in the weeks after the events.For instance, bitcoin surged 15% in the three days before the SEC approved the first futures ETFs. A month later it hit a record high $69,000 and then crashed into a bear market that lasted for more than a year.Read more: Bitcoin Traders Pare Bullish Bias as Spot ETF Deadline NearsCryptoQuant suggested last week that bitcoin could slump to as low as $32,000 because the amount of unrealized profits in the market is at a level that historically precedes a so-called price correction, often considered a drop of 10% in crypto markets. Bitcoin rallied 160% last year and has gained almost 4% this month.CryptoQuant is not alone in predicting a decline. QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm, said on Telegram last month that initial demand for the ETFs could be lower than expected, setting the stage for a classic sell-the-news scenario.Investors concerned about a replay of what followed the launches of CME futures and ProShares' BITO may want to note that both came when the market, having rallied by several hundred percent in 12 months, looked ripe for a correction.This time round, the expected spot ETF launch comes ahead of the Bitcoin blockchain's quadrennial mining-reward halving, which has previously marked the beginning of meteoric price rallies. It also follows this week's brief price slide to $41,000 in a sell-off that liquidated $400 million in leverage bets and wiped out $2 billion in futures open interest.Recycled cash or fresh flows?The difference between earlier sell-the-news events and this one is that a spot bitcoin ETF involves actual bitcoin, removing supply from the market. The CME's launch of futures prompted price declines because it allowed traders to synthetically short the cryptocurrency following a ferocious bull market that was led by 2017's unsustainable ICO mania.Another aspect of a spot bitcoin ETF is that institutional investors such as the typically conservative pension funds and insurance funds will gain a way to add exposure to native bitcoin, as opposed to an ETF derivative or bitcoin proxy shares like Coinbase (COIN) or MicroStrategy (MSTR).There are currently 35 gold ETFs in the U.S., with total assets under management standing at $118.70 billion. A recent report by financial services firm NYDIG drew parallels between them and a potential bitcoin ETF.\"Given Bitcoin’s roughly 3.6 times higher volatility compared to gold, investors would need approximately 3.6 times less Bitcoin than dollar-denominated gold to achieve an equivalent level of risk exposure,\" the report said. \"This would still translate to an additional demand of nearly $30 billion for a Bitcoin ETF.\"UPDATE (Jan. 5, 14:05 UTC): Adds bullet points at top of the story.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesInvestors poured over $2 billion into digital-asset investment exchange-traded products (ETPs) in 2023, making it the third-largest year for net inflows dating back to 2017, according to data provided by CoinShares. At $2.2 billion, inflows were more than double those of 2022. Most of the money hit in the final quarter, said CoinShares' James Butterfill, as it became “increasingly clear that the SEC was warming up to the launch of bitcoin spot-based ETFs in the United States.” The final week of 2023 alone saw $243 million of net inflows into digital asset ETPs.Ether (ETH) prices might gain in the coming weeks after crypto lender Celsius, which is restructuring in bankruptcy proceedings, said it will unstake its holdings of the second-largest cryptocurrency, removing a factor that may have contributed to the token’s underperformance in recent months. The company, which is converting to become a bitcoin miner, had previously said it would include staking in its activities. The firm has been selling staking rewards on the open market to cover costs associated with the reorganization plan. \"Celsius will unstake existing ETH holdings, which have provided valuable staking rewards income to the estate, to offset certain costs incurred throughout the restructuring process,\" the firm said in an X post. \"The significant unstaking activity in the next few days will unlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors.\"Celestia’s TIA token gained over 22% in the past 24 hours, bucking the muted broader market trend, as investor interest in staking the token gained momentum alongside rising hype for the blockchain's underlying technology. TIA traded at just under $17 in the early Asian morning hours Friday before giving back some gains. It recorded nearly $800 million in trading volume in the past 24 hours, its highest to date, data from CoinGecko shows. Staking involves locking coins in a cryptocurrency network in return for rewards. Doing so with TIA on native platforms yields between 15% to 17% annually, minus fees, to users. The unusually high yield compared with the so-called risk-free rate of 4% offered by the U.S. 10-year Treasury note seems to be drawing demand for the cryptocurrency. As of Friday, the market capitalization of TIA is just under $2 billion – meaning as valuations likely grow further in a bull market, participants could make money from both the inflated value of rewards and the initial staked capital.Chart of the DayThe chart shows bitcoin's 1% market depth, or collection of buy and sell orders within 1% of the mid-price – the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices.The market depth, a gauge of assessing order book liquidity, shows how easy it is for traders to trade large quantities at stable prices.While bitcoin rallied 60% in the final three months of 2023, the 1% market depth failed to recover from the dip brought by Alameda's demise in late 2022.Perhaps the situation will improve following the anticipated launch of spot ETFs, as some analysts project.Source: Kaiko- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsBitcoin ETF Fees Will Play Critical Role in the Race to PopularityAustralian Treasury to Question Regulator Over HyperVerse Crypto Scheme: ReportIndia's Digital Rupee Crossed a Million Transactions in 1 Day With Some Help From BanksEdited by Sheldon Reback."

On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 4.1% against estimates for 3.9% and up from November's 4.0%.Traditional markets are off to a shaky start in 2024, with the Nasdaq, for instance, currently on a five-day losing streak, its first such string of negative days since late 2022. The 10-year Treasury yield – which plunged more than 120 basis points in the final quarter of 2023 on rate cut hopes – is up 25 basis points over the past few sessions and again topping 4%. Putting markets on edge is the idea that investors may have gotten ahead of themselves in predicting a sizable regime of rate cuts to come in 2024.According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there's about a 65% chance of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut at or before the central bank's March meeting. And by year-end, markets are predicting nearly an 80% chance of 125 basis points or more of rate cuts.While the economic data of late – modestly slowing growth and a continued softening in inflation – has confirmed the argument for the Fed to hold its benchmark fed funds rate range steady at 5.25%-5.5%, the numbers thus far, including this morning's jobs numbers, are a long way from making the case for a long, deep series of rate cuts.In response to the report, U.S. stock equity futures have turned slightly lower, the S&P 500 down 0.2%. The 10-year Treasury yield is higher by seven basis points to 4.08% and the U.S. dollar index has moved up by 0.25%."

These vehicles are considered superior to already listed futures-based offerings and bulls are betting they will attract significant inflows to the largest cryptocurrency.However, a survey released Thursday by Bitwise and VettaFi curiously found that only 39% of financial advisors expected a spot BTC approval this year.Perhaps more interestingly though, the same survey showed 88% of those advisors see the spot ETF as a major catalyst and would be interested in buying bitcoin after approval. Bitwise is among those asset managers with spot bitcoin ETF applications awaiting word from the SEC.Ether may come nextMatrixport research head Markus Thielen, author of yesterday's report calling for a potential rejection or delayed approval, clarified Thursday in a CoinDesk podcast interview that he ultimately expects the U.S. agency to allow spot-based ETFs, but bitcoin may fall to lower prices in the coming weeks as technical indicators signal the uptrend is faltering.Thielen also said that once spot BTC ETFs get the green light, investors will quickly switch their focus to Ethereum's ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a decision for spot-based ether ETF applications likely due around May.\"We would expect then we're going to see some large outperformance of ETH over BTC,\" Thielen predicted.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Matrixport's out-of-consensus report served as a catalyst to unwind overleveraged positions leading to cascading liquidations, exacerbating the downfall. Nearly $560 million of leveraged long derivatives trading positions – bets on higher prices with borrowed money – had been wiped out through Wednesday, the highest amount in at least three months, CoinGlass data shows. CryptoQuant also attributed the decline to exceptionally high funding rates on the bitcoin futures market, adding selling pressure from bitcoin miners and high profit rates of short-term holders as contributing factors. Major tokens solana (SOL), ether (ETH) and Cardano’s ADA started to stabilize early Thursday after dropping more than 10% in 24 hours.

The long-awaited liquidity easing has been widely touted as a critical bullish tailwind for bitcoin (BTC) alongside the impending spot ETF launch and the Bitcoin blockchain's quadrennial mining-reward halving. There is a catch. Past data sourced from MacroMicro shows that the early stages of the supposedly stimulatory Fed rate-cut cycle are often characterized by the economy on the brink of a recession and brief but notable rally in the U.S. dollar, a global reserve currency backed by the world's largest and most liquid government bond market.Goldman Sachs, the high-profile Wall Street investment bank, looks likely to play a key role for the bitcoin ETFs that BlackRock and Grayscale want to introduce in the U.S., according to two people familiar with the situation. The company is in talks to be an authorized participant, or AP, for the exchange-traded funds, according to the people, who requested anonymity. That's one of the most important jobs in the multi trillion-dollar ETF industry, a role that involves creating and redeeming ETF shares to ensure the products trade in lockstep with their underlying assets. Goldman Sachs would join other finance giants in taking on that role.

Consequently, bitcoin's price recovered from Wednesday's lows to around $42,900 by afternoon UTC time, but was still trading nearly 5% lower over the past 24 hours.The rapid decline came within a day of CNBC host and former hedge fund manager Jim Cramer's positive comments about bitcoin, walking back on his negative outlook in October. While it's unlikely to be, observers didn't fail to single out his comment in hindsight as a sign for falling prices, riffing on a popular meme of Cramer's internet-famous track record of backfiring takes. (For instance, BTC is still up roughly 60% since his October remark.)Read more: Jim Cramer Doesn't Know BitcoinWhat caused the bitcoin dropK33 Research Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde said the market was overheated and over-leveraged, leaving it highly vulnerable to the downside.\"Leverage in the market was very high prior to the crash, with longs being the key aggressor, evident by funding rates and futures premiums pushing to annualized rates above 50%,\" Lunde explained in an interview via email. \"This left the market extremely exposed to downside volatility.\"Matrixport's out-of-consensus report served as an adequate catalyst to unwind overleveraged positions leading to cascading liquidations, exacerbating the downfall. Nearly $560 million of leveraged long derivatives trading positions – bets on higher prices with borrowed money – has been wiped out through Wednesday until press time, the highest amount in at least three months, CoinGlass data shows.\"[It's] a typical long liquidation flush,\" Lunde said.Crypto derivatives liquidations soared Wednesday, exacerbating the decline in prices. (CoinGlass)Digital asset research firm CryptoQuant also attributed the decline to exceptionally high funding rates on the bitcoin futures market, adding selling pressure from bitcoin miners and high profit rates of short-term holders as contributing factors.CryptoQuant analysts last week said that a spot bitcoin ETF approval is likely to happen and potentially be a \"sell the news\" event that could pull BTC to $32,000.Spot bitcoin ETFs still likely to be approvedLMAX strategist Joel Kruger said in an emailed note that the overwhelming consensus is that an approval for a bitcoin ETF in the US is \"a matter of when, not if.\"K33's Lunde was of a similar opinion, saying that a denial seems highly unlikely based on Grayscale's court win, and all back-and-forth between the SEC and issuers leading to updated S-1s and cash creations.\"Read more: Bitcoin ETF Looks Very Likely Given These Bureaucratic SEC StepsLMAX's Kruger opined that Wednesday's pullback is likely a short-term price movement and expects a 10% bitcoin rally within one-two days of the approval's announcement and all-time high prices later this year.Edited by Nikhilesh De."

This can occur when a trader sells USDC for USDT and there isn't sufficient liquidity to maintain the $1 peg.USDC/USDT chart (TradingView)The 2% market depth on Binance for the USDC/USDT pair is skewed to the upside, with $26 million in orders stacked up to $1.02 and $6.1 million in orders stacked down to $0.98, according to CoinMarketCap. This means that when a trader makes a sell order larger than $6.1 million, the price would fall below $0.98. There was $6.2 million worth of volume at 12:10 UTC followed by $4.3 million at 12:21 UTC.More than $500 million in derivative positions were liquidated following a report by Matrixport, which predicted the SEC would reject a number of spot bitcoin ETF applications this month.It's worth noting that this trading pair has experienced several slight depegs over the past few months, although none of those exceeded 4% in either direction.The last time USDC lost its peg was in March following the collapse of Silicon Valley bank, when it traded down at $0.86 after it was revealed that Circle had a portion of funds backing the stablecoin held at the beleaguered bank.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Only twice in the past five years has the largest cryptocurrency gained in January, according to data from TradingView. Bitcoin gained 40% last January, but lost 16% the year before. It dropped 8% over 24 hours to trade at around $42,000 on Wednesday. Still, there's room for bitcoin to rally should a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) be approved in the U.S., According to LMAX Digital. “As much as the event has been priced in, considering how much hangs in the balance, there is definitely some money sitting on the sidelines, waiting for an actual confirmation,” it said in a morning note. “We anticipate the rally in the immediate aftermath could amount to a move of about 10% over the course of a day or two.”MicroStrategy (MSTR) executive chairman Michael Saylor began to sell $216 million worth of stock options of the company on Tuesday, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The document shows Saylor proposed the sale of 310,000 stock option awards granted in 2014, which will expire in April. Saylor said during Microstrategy's third-quarter earnings call that he plans to sell 5,000 shares per trading day over the course of the next four months, subject to a minimum price condition. The plan was disclosed in that quarter's 10-Q filing, which said he can sell up to 400,000 shares of his vested options through April 26.Jim Cramer, a former hedge fund manager and the host of CNBC’s Mad Money, on Tuesday reversed his previously bearish stance on bitcoin (BTC) ahead of what's expected to be U.S. regulatory approval of a spot ETF and as the price rose above $45,000 for the first time in 21 months. \"This thing, you can't kill it,\" Cramer told CNBC's David Faber. \"Bitcoin is a technological marvel and I think people need to start recognizing it's here to stay.\" Cramer also took note of another famous bitcoin skeptic (to put it mildly), saying the late Charlie Munger \"was blind to this.\" Cramer's comments stand in contrast to his remarks in early October during the Sam Bankman-Fried trial, when he said he wasn't interested in getting long the crypto as \"Mr Bitcoin is about to go down big.\" Prior to that, Cramer said he had sold most of his bitcoin holdings in 2021 after the China mining crackdown.Trending PostsEU Banking Watchdog to Deepen Probe of Links Between Banks, Crypto Entities: FTBitcoin Miners Offload $129M BTC in Day, Sending Reserves to the Lowest Point Since MayBRC-20 Marketplace, Creator Take Opposing Positions on Proposed Network UpgradeEdited by Sheldon Reback."

A Reuters report over the weekend suggested the regulatory agency could begin notifying ETF sponsors as soon as Tuesday that their applications were to be approved.Traditional-finance heavyweights such as BlackRock and VanEck are among the 13 companies in the race – and the move could fuel buying pressure for bitcoin in the coming months as the first regulated spot bitcoin product in the U.S., traders expect.

A call offers the right to buy; a put confers the right to sell. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC or one ETH. An in-the-money call option is one with a strike price lower than the market rate. For a put, an in-the money strike price is higher than the going rate.This quarter's 60% upswing in the bitcoin price and ether's 43% gain have investors scrambling to add upside exposure through calls. That explains the record notional open interest for in-the-money call options.According to Strijers, clients have been rolling their positions from the December expiry to contracts expiring in January and subsequent months, and the process could continue into Friday's quarterly settlement.\"Beyond hedging, we also see clients rolling positions to 2024 expiries and expect to see more of that closer to the expiry as well as afterward,\" Strijers said. \"After the expiration, all eyes and trading activity will be focused on the upcoming ETF decision.\"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is said to have set Jan. 10 as the deadline for approving or rejecting an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests directly in bitcoin, a so-called spot ETF, rather than one investing in futures tied to BTC. Many industry participants expect it to give the green light to a spot fund, paving the way for continued upside price volatility in the historically bullish reward halving year.Most open interest in concentrated in calls or derivatives offering upside protection. (Deribit) (Deribit)The chart shows notional open interest for the BTC call and put options at various strikes expiring on Friday.It also shows bitcoin's max pain point (MPP), or the level at which options buyers stand to lose the most on expiry. The theory is that options sellers, typically institutions with ample capital supply, look to push the underlying asset's spot price toward that level to make their counterparties, the buyers, suffer the most. In late 2020 and most of 2021, bitcoin saw volatility in the direction of the max pain point in the lead-up to the expiry, only to resuming the uptrend following the settlement.Still, market analyst Chang expects prices to remain steady before Friday's expiry.\"BTC MPP is $33,000 and ETH MPP is $1,900, very far from current prices. MPP can provide important points from time to time, but for now, we expect BTC and ETH to move to MPP very little. There is no need to worry much about MPP at the moment. If something like that were to happen, it would only be possible if there was a disaster on Earth,\" Chang told CoinDesk.\"I plan to keep a close eye on any new options trading tapes after the big options expirations. I also think the market is heading towards the final spark and I expect the last real move to be very soon,\" Chang said.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Metrics show Solana has possibly been the strongest draw among on-chain traders, with trading volumes and network fees crossing those of Ethereum – which is usually the highest – on a seven-day rolling basis. Value locked on Solana applications grew in tandem, rising to $1.3 billion worth of tokens from November's $400 million to reach levels previously seen in July 2022. Also gaining was layer 2 Optimism’s OP token, which climbed 23% over the past 24 hours. Optimism’s total value locked (TVL) is approaching $900 million according to data from DeFi Llama. Bitcoin was down slightly on the day.Hong Kong regulators said they are ready to consider applications for spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In a joint statement, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said the virtual asset environment has changed since 2018, when the SFC formulated a \"professional-investors only\" regulatory approach. Hong Kong has been loosening its approach to crypto this year, and the regulators' opinion on retail exposure to digital assets has shifted. In October, the SFC updated its rule book to allow a broader range of investors to engage in spot-crypto and ETF investing. Then, last month, SFC Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung said the regulator was moving toward allowing retail amid investors to buy spot crypto ETFs and would \"welcome proposals using innovative technology that boosts efficiency and customer experience\" provided any risks were addressed.Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) said it received registration as a Virtual Asset Services Provider in France, allowing it to offer a \"full suite of retail, institutional, and ecosystem products and services\" in the country. The registration with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) was announced the same day as stablecoin issuer Circle said it was granted conditional registration by the regulator as France looks to attract crypto businesses. Coinbase is the third-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, according to CoinGecko, surpassed only by Binance, which is also registered in the country, and Bybit. Registration allows it to offer custody of digital assets, buying and selling of digital assets for fiat currency and trading of digital assets, Coinbase saidTrending PostsSolana, Avax, Helium Led Digital Assets Gains This Year.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesLayer-1 blockchain Solana (SOL) led the way in 2023 in terms of token price gains, with other altcoins Avalanche (AVAX), Stacks (STX) and Helium’s (HNT) following closely behind. Solana, which began its sharp increase in mid-October, has risen over 700% since the start of the year. HNT also made considerable gains, climbing 500%. Most of the advance came this month, following the company’s move into the mobile space. For Avalanche, there have been a number of institutional partnerships that helped lift the token some 300% year-to-date. Looking forward, analysts pointed to tokenization of real-world assets as a booming segment to watch. Chris Newhouse, a former derivatives trader and the founder of Infiniti Labs, said the “Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) narrative” will continue to be a hot topic, with tokens such as RNDR and HNT recently outperforming the market. DePINs use cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize building of real-world infrastructure.More than $1 billion in assets belonging to the founders of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) have been frozen by a British Virgin Islands court, according to the firm's liquidators, Teneo Restructuring. The worldwide court order, issued Monday, applies to founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies as well as Davies' wife, Kelly Chen, Teneo said in an email. 3AC filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in July last year after the collapse of stablecoin issuer Terra caused irrecoverable losses. Teneo has been seeking $1.3 billion and included Chen in the order to use all available avenues to maximize returns to creditors, whose claims total more than $3 billion. Zhu, jailed for four months in Singapore in September for failing to help wind up 3AC, is expected to be released this month for good behavior.Bitcoin (BTC) neared the $44,000 level early Thursday and reversed some losses, which were caused by the sudden drop in U.S. stocks on Wednesday. The S&P 500 index fell 1.42% Wednesday, hurting riskier assets such as bitcoin. Some analysts pointed out that a correction was overdue as market indications were in overbought territory and the expiry of a certain type of options created selling pressure. Bitcoin and trending tokens such as Solana’s SOL and Avalanche’s AVAX took a hit after the broader market plunge but climbed in early Asian hours on Thursday. SOL extended gains to 15% in the past 24 hours, and the advance from a multiweek rally to over 55%.Chart of the DayGrayscale’s Bitcoin Trust Fund (GBTC) discount to net asset value (NAV) is holding near the narrowest since August 2021.The discount widened slightly to 7.90% on WednesdayThe discount has been shrinking as a result of optimism that a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved in the U.S.GBTC is the world’s largest bitcoin investment vehicle and has traded at a discount since February 2021 and hit record lows of nearly 50% in December last year.Source: ycharts- Lyllah LedesmaTrending PostsBlockchain Tech Predictions for 2024, From Experts at Ripple, Coinbase, a16z, StarknetVladimir Putin's Signature Brings Digital Ruble Into Russia's Tax CodeThe Sandbox Aims To Make India Its Largest MarketEdited by Sheldon Reback."

Bitcoin’s weekly RSI stands at around 75, down from 82 at the beginning of the month,” Lin added.The RSI indciator calculates the magnitude of price movements for assets, with readings below 30 indicating prices of an asset have fallen further than its fundamental value.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

This could result in short-term volatility for bitcoin, which will shift the focus towards ether (ETH).“It is likely that the actual demand for the bitcoin spot ETF at the start will fall short of market expectations,” QCP wrote. “We expect topside resistance for bitcoin in the $45k-$48.5k region and a possible retracement to 36k levels before the uptrend resumes.”Bitcoin is currently trading above $43,700 during Asia business hours, up 2% on-day.QCP writes that ether is seen as a potential secondary investment option with an anticipated market shift from bitcoin, and speculative interest in a forthcoming ether spot ETF could drive ether prices higher, even before the ETF’s actual launch.“Ether might also be an interesting laggard play here,” they wrote. “This kind of headline excitement could create some speculative uplift for ETH price whether it is warranted or not.”CoinDesk reported that BlackRock (BLK), Nasdaq (NDAQ), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) held their second meeting in a month to discuss rule changes for listing the bitcoin ETF, with BlackRock modifying its proposal to include cash redemptions, aligning with SEC preferences.Grayscale also recently had a second meeting with the SEC.Bitcoin is up 17% in the last month, according to CoinDesk Indicies data, as anticipation builds around the ETF.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "A lot of blockchain developers probably feel like they're working on the cutting edge of the cutting edge, building the financial and business infrastructure of the future. It’s nothing short of a revolution. Based on what we've seen, and reported, they're not wrong. Or, at least, it seems safe to say, the pace of innovation and speed of new developments in the blockchain space rarely ceases to stun; except for those moments when it all seems to look alike.This year's crypto-market doldrums brought little respite from the announcements, product rollouts, integrations, partnerships, collaborations, fundraisings, launches, deployments, migrations, transitions. There's a lot of transformation, and information, all quite technical, complex; as hard as it can be to catch up, keeping up is equally daunting. Imagine piloting a spaceship through a dense asteroid field while playing a game of Concentration with the individual asteroids; pattern recognition might be your only hope.A few key 2023 trends were broadly foreseen by the experts. Many weren't. Truth be told, nobody really knows where all of this is going. We curated 10 predictions from blockchain tech experts for 2024; their prognostications are as good as any, and quite technical. Bonne chance.This post is part of CoinDesk's \"Crypto 2024\" predictions package. AND: this article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast. And our can't-miss column of blockchain tech updates, Protocol Village.Interoperability\"By 2024 and beyond, the advancement of blockchain interoperability protocols will mark a major shift by breaking down the existing silos between different blockchains. This shift will enable diverse blockchain platforms to seamlessly interact by sharing data and value transfer, creating a unified and more efficient blockchain ecosystem. The role of interoperability protocols will be crucial in this transformation, as they will increase innovation, as well as foster new applications and use cases, specifically in DeFi.\" - David Schwartz, CTO, Ripple Labs.Bitcoin fees\"In light of decreasing fixed block rewards for miners, our view is that catalysts for raising the variable block rewards from transaction fees will be increasingly important. The core Bitcoin protocol is in a largely stable state, with the Taproot upgrade in November 2021 being the only major protocol upgrade in the past five years – at least with regards to changes that have required a soft fork. Thus, we believe usage catalysts will originate from technological innovation, mostly within the confines of the existing network protocol such as increased usage of blob data like Ordinals and Atomicals, elevated activity on secondary layer 2s like the Lightning Network (LN), or general smart-contract environments built on top of the Bitcoin network like Rootstock, Stacks, RGB or future implementations of BitVM.\" - David Duong, head of institutional research, Coinbase.Modularity“We’ve also seen a consolidation on the modular thesis and exciting developments in this space as more and more hybrid solutions come to market such as Ethereum roll ups using Celestia as the data availability layer. Meanwhile we also have blockchains like Solana continuing in its monolithic direction and saying no to layer 2s because they view them as bad for liquidity and the user experience. It will be interesting to watch these two narratives play out in 2024, especially as some Ethereum rollups explore using the Solana virtual machine.” - Abdelhamid Bakhta, lead and core Ethereum developer, Starknet ecosystem.UnmuteZero-Knowledge Proofs\"SNARKs allow the computation of a 'cryptographic receipt' of some compute workload by an untrusted “prover” impossible to forge: In the past computing such a receipt cost 10^9 work overhead over the original compute; recent advances are bringing this number closer to 10^6. SNARKs therefore become viable in situations where the initial compute provider can bear a 10^6 overhead and the clients cannot re-execute or store initial data. The use cases that result are many: Edge devices in the Internet of Things can verify upgrades. Media editing software can embed content authenticity and transformation data; while remixed memes could pay homage to initial sources. LLM inferences could include authenticity information. We could have self-verifying IRS forms, unforgeable bank audits, and many more uses that benefit consumers ahead.\" - Sam Ragsdale, investment engineer, a16z.Key management/user interfaces“The emergence of account abstraction means that we can soon overcome the technical challenges of self-custody. 2024 will be the year that seed phrases can finally become a historical practice for most. The idea that the safety of assets meant having 12 words that you can never lose, but no one else can ever access, is outdated and to a large extent has been holding back progress for actual user adoption. As such, blockchain is in a position to deliver on the promise of inclusive finance that’s been so central to our values since the beginning.” - Friederike Ernst, co-founder, Gnosis and Gnosis Pay.Censorship\"Centralization concerns essentially boil down to two core issues: (1) Does a certain vector of centralization lead to network performance issues that put applications at risk of outages? And (2) will centralization create censorship challenges? One of the interesting things about the disentanglement of block building, relaying and validation in Ethereum is that it cleanly separates censorship challenges between three different layers of the Ethereum transaction processing stack. After the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash addresses last summer, major Ethereum relays began to censor transactions. The problem only abated once Flashbots open-sourced its market-dominant relay, and allowed permissionless relays like Ultra Sound, Agnostic and bloXroute to become more competitive. Today, it's block builders who have increasingly begun to censor transactions. I'd expect some of the biggest development breakthroughs in 2024 to come in areas like mempool encryption that shield transactions from potentially censorious parties before they are included in a block.\" - Ryan Selkis, founder and CEO, Messari.Security/privacy\"In 2023 there have been tons of hacks and fraud within the crypto space including Euler Finance and Angle Protocol. We will see blockchain protocols creating more security solutions and taking privacy more seriously.\" - Ramani Ramachandran, CEO, Router Protocol.Corporate crypto\"Networks and developer platforms should be prepared for onboarding corporate and startup builders, as well as independent developers. Network protocol teams should be prepared with user experiences that can reach millions of end users in their native digital experiences.

As a result, the DeFi protocols residing natively on layer-2 chains have seen an outflow of liquidity for a large part of the year. However, as gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet rise in line with spikes in activity, a part of the new capital will be flowing to the Layer-2 chains as their new home next year.\" - CCData outlook report, from the digital-assets data and analytics firm previously known as CryptoCompare.(Or maybe, alternatively, or simultaneously) Layer-2 consolidation\"Ethereum will implement EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), which will reduce transaction fees and improve scalability for layer-2 chains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism and others.

Moving assets to exchanges usually signals an intention to sell, indicating that many investors decided to take some profits after bitcoin's 65% rally from $27,000 in October.If BTC were to finish the week below $43,800, it would end an eight-week streak of gains, the longest winning streak since April to June 2017, according to TradingView historical data.BTC was changing hands at around $42,000 at press time, down almost 4% since the start of the week.Experts predict BTC all-time high prices for next yearThe recent dip in price is likely just a blip on the radar, as bitcoin is primed for a strong 2024 with multiple investment narratives supporting rising prices, experts argued.\"I do think this kind of trading is normal,\" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in an interview with CoinDesk TV on Friday. \"If you look at other asset classes, things don't move in straight lines.\"UnmuteMarket participants expect interest rates to fall \"aggressively\" in the U.S., U.K. and Europe for the next couple of years, which is more beneficial for risky assets compared to the past 18 months of rising rates, Erlam explained. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting an all-time high this week underscored the improvement in investors' risk-appetite, he added.\"To take a breather and define a new range can be seen as a healthy sign,\" Anthony Rousseau, head of brokerage solutions at TradeStation, said in an emailed note.He said the Federal Reserve hinting at easing monetary policy and cutting rates next year injected a \"windfall of confidence\" in risk assets like crypto, but the more prevalent theme is still an increasingly anticipated U.S. regulatory approval for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by BlackRock and others, and the fresh demand for BTC they would unleash.Meanwhile, long-term holders – or HODLers, who hold on to their assets for at least a year without moving – haven't started selling despite the short-term profit-taking, Rousseau noted, making bitcoin's supply increasingly restricted.\"It’s possible we have the perfect storm brewing for a strong 2024, with the possibility of closing in on all-time highs by the end of 2024,” he said.All-time highs could come even sooner, crypto trading platform WOO Network predicted, as spot ETF listings and bitcoin's upcoming halving in April, which will slash new BTC issuance by half, may create an enticing narrative combination.\"We targeted $75k for BTC in early 2024 and believe demand will increase heavily as the ETF and halving narratives combine, leading BTC to develop an additional narrative as a safe haven asset,\" WOO Network's year-end report said.Edited by Nick Baker."

The largest cryptocurrency is currently priced at around $42,600, down 0.65% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which offers a weighted view of the digital asset market at large, is down a similar amount. With a large degree of spot BTC ETF enthusiasm already priced into asset prices and with no decision on the approval of applications to list such a fund by the SEC expected until the new year, the crypto market is showing signs of ticking along sideways for the remainder of 2023.Sales of Solana's smartphone are surging thanks to an airdrop of 30 million BONK tokens available to owners of the previously struggling Saga phone. \"Saga sales have >10x'd in the past 48 hours, and are now on track to sell out before the new year,\" Solana co-founder Raj Gokal tweeted Thursday. The surge is so pronounced that Gokal's counterpart, Anatoly Yakovenko, tweeted they needed to raise the price. BONK, Solana's equivalent of dog-themed meme coin dogecoin, can seemingly take the credit for the turnaround in Saga's fortunes, with users saying on the Discord servers that they had just bought the phone to take advantage of the airdrop.Crypto custody firm Qredo's crypto exchange Ankex has closed its doors. CEO Michael Moro, formerly of Genesis Trading, has already moved on. Ankex sought to combine a non-custodial DeFi approach with elements familiar to professional traders such as a central limit order book, earlier this year, but its \"development has been paused,\" the exchange said in a message to its community. \"As some of you tested earlier this year, Ankex was ready for a public beta launch.

        "content": "The first-ever sale by Sotheby's of \"inscriptions\" created using the Bitcoin blockchain's Ordinals protocol – from a pixelated collection known as \"BitcoinShrooms\" – drew about $450,000, or five times the highest estimates, potentially revealing a mainstream fervor for the tradable digital images colloquially referred to as \"NFTs on Bitcoin.\"The auction, which concluded on Wednesday, consisted of three of the images, including a pixelated avocado that fetched more than $100,000 and a design that appears to be derived from a mushroom in the Super Mario franchise that sold for north of $240,000, according to Derek Parsons, a spokesman for the auction house. There were 148 total bids across the three lots, and more than two-thirds of all bidders were new to Sotheby's.There are \"plans for more soon,\" Parsons wrote in an email.The results recall the mania that swept digital-asset markets a couple years ago when digital artwork and non-fungible tokens or \"NFTs\" first started drawing eye-popping sums, and captured mainstream attention; one NFT by the artist Beeple drew $69 million at the auction house Christie's. Many of those collections, however, were built atop the Ethereum blockchain.The Ordinals inscriptions, which debuted late last year featuring a new technology pioneered by Casey Rodarmor atop Bitcoin have witnessed bouts of popularity this year sufficient to cause congestion and elevated fees on the distributed network, launched in 2009 to be a peer-to-peer payments network.There's a debate raging among Bitcoin users and developers over whether to filter out transactions in NFT-like \"inscriptions\" minted using the Ordinals project, since they're not a core financial use in keeping with many advocates' vision for the original blockchain.So the idea that some of the images might be considered high art could tip the scales of the debate toward profit interests.The three digital images come from the BitcoinShrooms collection of Ordinals inscriptions, by the pseudonymous artist Shroomtoshi, according to the Sotheby's website.The digital avocado, known as \"BIP39 SEED,\" was initially tipped to draw $20,000 to $30,000, but it ended up selling for $101,600.EDITOR'S NOTE: After publication of this story, this reporter received a direct message from the @BitcoinShrooms account on X (formerly Twitter) asserting that \"there is no affiliation to the Nintendo brand,\" requesting removal of \"any reference to Super Mario or Nintendo to avoid confusing your readers.\"\"This is Shroomtoshi,\" the sender wrote. \"The sole inspiration for this project was Bitcoin, and the reason behind the use of the mushroom is explained here: https://ord.io/35458816.\"The link leads to what appears to be an interview with the artist posted on Oct. 24, in which they explained that \"Mushrooms are neat and easy to customize, and allow you to express bitcoin concepts as complex and diverse as sighash_noinput and separation of money and state on something as small as a 32x32px canvas.\"Screenshot from the Sotheby's website.

        "content": "The so-called \"dots\" released Wednesday as part of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision showed central bankers expect 75 basis points in rate cuts in 2024. That's up substantially from just 25 basis points expected by policymakers three months ago.The Fed's dot plot (Federal Reserve)Already in a sharp upswing since October on expectations of easier monetary policy, traditional markets soared further on the news, with all three major U.S. stock indexes climbing more than 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 37,000 for the first time ever. Stocks are higher again Thursday, though more modestly.Read more: Federal Reserve Holds Policy Steady, but Indicates More Dovish 2024The rally in the bond market has been even bigger, with the yield on two-year U.S. Treasuries now having plunged roughly 40 basis points since the news hit to 4.32%, its lowest level since May. With the current fed funds rate, or overnight borrowing rate, at 5.25% to 5.5%, two-year money at 4.32% shows a substantial belief that significant rate cuts are soon to come.Indeed, the CME FedWatch tool now shows a 21% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut as soon as January and an 84% chance of one or more rate cuts by March.Checking other rate-sensitive markets, the U.S. dollar index is lower by about 2% since Wednesday's Fed news and gold has rallied 2.5% – both of which further suggest TradFi is, for now, fully buying into the rate cut story.The Fed's dovish signal also boosted the price of bitcoin (BTC), which this week has been trying to recover from Sunday evening's \"flash crash\" that saw prices tumble more than 5% in the space of a few minutes. At $43,200 as of press time, bitcoin is now only lower by about 1% from its pre-crash price.Are market participants getting ahead of themselves?While the Fed's median forecast is for 75 basis points in rate cuts in 2024, markets have priced in nearly 150 basis points. Needless to say, for even the Fed's more modest expectation to materialize, it would require a substantial slowdown in the economy and/or inflation.Claims of imminent recession have been popular this year, but the data continues to say otherwise. Third-quarter annualized gross domestic product growth was a whopping 5.2% – the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2021, when substantial government Covid stimulus was still sloshing through the economy. And just this morning saw even more good news, with a big decline in weekly initial jobless claims to their lowest level in two months and an unexpected rise in retail sales for November.As for inflation, while it has subsided significantly from near double-digit levels in 2022, at 3.1% based on the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI), it remains well above the Fed's 2% target. The core rate of inflation – which typically garners more attention from central bank policymakers – has been more stubborn in coming down, and remained at 4% in the most recent report.Edited by Nick Baker."

The SEC's decision on approving a spot BTC ETF is unlikely to spur major gains as there is a “high chance of buy-the-rumor/sell-the-fact effect,\" JPMorgan analysts wrote on Wednesday. Ether is likely to shine due to the EIP-4844 upgrade, or proto-danksharding. That's a development of sharding – splitting the network into shards to improve transaction speed – by way of Danksharding, which uses the shards to increase space for groups of data. Proto-danksharding involves adding a new transaction type to Ethereum: the “blob-carrying transaction.”Cathie Wood’s investment firm, ARK Invest, offloaded a sizeable chunk of Coinbase as the shares of the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange rose to a 20-month high on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, COIN rose more than 7.7% to top $150 for the first time since April 2022. Despite recent sales, the exchange still constitutes over 10% of ARK’s portfolio and retains the top spot on the investment firm’s list of top 10 holdings. The investment firm also sold some $1.63 million shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.The value locked on Cardano’s ecosystem grew rapidly in the past few weeks as a recent boost in Ethereum alternatives is likely pushing crypto investors and users toward other blockchains in search of returns and capital allocation. The total value locked in all Cardano-based projects jumped to over $440 million earlier this week, crossing a previous peak of $330 million set in April. Cardano's ADA token has surged some 17% in the past 24 hours, extending its monthly gain to almost 80%. The total amount of capital locked or staked across all DeFi protocols reached $50 billion at the start of December for the first time in six months, led by Solana ecosystem protocols as optimism around the blockchain has picked up in recent weeks.Chart of the Day(Glassnode)The chart shows the ratio of open or active bitcoin puts and calls across derivative exchanges, including Deribit.The so-called put-call open interest ratio has increased from 0.40 to 0.52 in less than three weeks, signaling a growing bias for puts or options offering downside protection.Broadly speaking, the ratio remains well below 1, indicating an overall bullish bias.Source: Glassnode- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsGlobal Banking Regulator Proposes Changes to Criteria That Give Stablecoins Preferential Risk TreatmentFTX Bankruptcy Judge Takes Step to Shorten Timeline for Customers' RecoveriesIn Search of the Elusive Crypto VoterEdited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "Cognitive biases like anchoring may see investors anticipate a BTC price slide in the wake of this year’s 150% rally.Indicators like Puell Multiple, MVRV Z-Score, and Mayer Multiple suggest bitcoin is far from being overvalued and could continue to rally in 2024.Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has surged over 150% this year, beating traditional assets like the S&P 500, gold, and the U.S. dollar by a huge margin.That may have some investors, particularly those who haven’t seen the previous crypto bull runs and are “anchored” to the brutal bear market of 2022, intuitively view the cryptocurrency as being overvalued and anticipate a price slide in the coming months. Anchoring is a cognitive bias that causes investors to rely overly on recent or initial data while making future judgments.Traditional finance investors who want exposure to bitcoin could fall victim to the anchoring bias and intuitively wait for cheaper entry prices. That’s because, in conventional markets, assets rarely double in value in less than a year. Besides, investors, in general, are vulnerable to loss aversion, a cognitive behavior of booking out of winning trades early and holding on to loss-making bets for longer.Believing in the aforementioned cognitive biases, however, could prove costly as three indicators – tracking activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, miner flows, and the 200-day moving average – suggest the cryptocurrency has plenty of upside left.Let’s discuss these indicators in detail.Puell MultipleThe Puell Multiple measures the U.S. dollar value of the daily bitcoin issued relative to the 365-day moving average of the dollar value of the issuance. The issuance here refers to the current supply, i.e., minted or new coins released to the network. Since the last halving in early 2020, miners have minted roughly 900 tokens per day.Elevated readings indicate that the present profitability of miners is high compared to the yearly average, and hence, they could liquidate their holdings at a faster pace, adding to bearish pressures in the market. Low readings suggest otherwise.In the past, readings above four have coincided with market peaks, with values reaching as high as 10 in early bull cycles. Meanwhile, multiples of less than 0.5 have hinted at market bottoms.As of the time of writing, the Puell Multiple stood at 1.53, well short of the red zone above four, according to data tracked by Glassnode.The Puell Multiple could fall back toward the accumulation zone following Bitcoin's fourth reward halving in March. (Glassnode) (Glassnode)The indicator could slide back into the accumulation zone (below 0.5) early next year after bitcoin’s mining reward halving. The inbuilt code will cut the per-block issuance of bitcoin to 3.25 BTC from 6.5 BTC.“Because the quantity of BTC issued in the subsidy literally gets cut in half, the only way for this metric to recoup so quickly is for the price of BTC to rapidly increase,” analysts at Blockware Intelligence said in the latest edition of the weekly newsletter.“The next halving is estimated for March 2024. That’s not too far away at all,” analysts added.MVRV Z-scoreThe Z-score of bitcoin's market value-to-realized value (MVRV) ratio shows how many standard deviations the assets' market capitalization differs from its realized or fair value.The market capitalization is obtained by multiplying the total number of tokens in circulation by the going market price. The realized value is a variation of the market cap, which can be calculated by dividing the value of all bitcoins at the price they were last moved on-chain by the number of coins in circulation. The metric excludes coins lost from circulation and is said to reflect the fair value of the network.The metric measures the number of standard deviations the market capitalization differs from the realized or fair value. (Glassnode) (Glassnode)At press time, the Z-score stood at 1.6, indicating that the cryptocurrency is far from being overvalued and may continue to rally next year, as anticipated by several analysts.Historically, Z-scores above eight have signaled overvaluation and signaled bull market tops, while negative values have signaled discounted prices and bear market bottoms.Mayer MultipleThe Mayer Multiple, developed by bitcoin investor and podcast host Trace Mayer, measures the difference between bitcoin's going market price and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).The indicator helps identify overbought and oversold conditions by comparing the present market price with its 200-day moving average. The assumption is that the market will revert to its mean or the 200-day SMA after extended bullish/bearish trends push the multiple above 2.4/below 0.5.As of the time of writing, the Mayer Multiple was 1.404, meaning bitcoin’s price at $42,937 was 1.4 times its 200-day SMA at $30,563.In other words, bitcoin has plenty of room to rally before we can say it’s overbought relative to its 200-day SMA. The 200-day SMA is one of the most widely tracked gauges of long-term trends. As per technical analysis, an asset is said to be in a bull market once its value drops above the 200-day SMA and vice versa.Mayer multiple helps identify overbought and oversold conditions.

        "content": "Welcome back to the days of $40k bitcoin. Ethereum is also back above $2k, while smaller tokens play catch up to the mega caps, and just in time for the holidays too.Ah, the rollercoaster that is the crypto market. It’s a wild ride that keeps us on our toes and glued to our screens, doesn’t it? Protocols and projects are forged and refined in the fire of market cyclicality, with lesser ideas falling the wayside or exiting through the dramatic jumps and falls of the market.These cycles are rooted in some tangible factors that stem from a mix of demand dynamics driven by investor psychology, regulatory developments, and technological advancements meeting the supply demands of halving schedules, protocol forks and ICOs. When these factors align favorably, demand skyrockets causing prices to rocket higher, often fueled further by hype and the ubiquitous propellent known as FOMO (fear of missing out). That’s the halcyon days of the bull market where we bask in general euphoria, with the focus of fear being on further upside surprises.You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.But with every cycle there is a duality, a yin for every yang. Enter the infamous \"crypto winter.\" This icy period kicks in when sentiment gets overly bullish and investors excessively leveraged, resulting in a self-correcting market — prices plummet, investors panic, and the mood gets frostier than a New York winter bomb cyclone. Indicators of this chilling season? Prolonged price declines, increased market volatility, reduced trading volumes, and a general feeling of despair among investors who bought in during the hype and try to ignore the stress of unrealized losses.So, where in this cycle are we now, and why are we waving goodbye to crypto winter and stepping into warmer times?(Source: CoinDesk Indices)Bitcoin’s up by a solid 18% month over month, while the broader CoinDesk Markets Index (CMI), which tracks the wider market, is up 21%. The outperformance of CMI over bitcoin shows the preference for lower cap altcoins, a positive cycle indicator due alongside positive Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicator values and the buzz around spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues to heat up. We’re seeing a surge in inflows into crypto investment funds, and even meme-coins are making a comeback — yeah, they’re back in the game. Plus, the end of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial gives the crypto world a fresh start.Why are we out of the deep freeze? Well, it’s all about a shift in the narrative. Wall Street is entering the scene big time, talking billions in investments through ETFs. They’re spinning a tale of mainstream institutions swooping in to save the day, making crypto safer and more transparent for investors.The focus now? More regulated crypto exchanges, building broader and more sustainable products like ETFs, tokenized securities, and stablecoins — not the frothy inside joke stuff of meme coins and overpriced NFTs we saw in the COVID frenzy.This shift might ruffle some feathers, straying from crypto’s original ethos as an alternative to mainstream finance. But, hey, it’s what’s revving up excitement again. And it’s not just Wall Street driving this. Macro factors like the potential end of the U.S. interest rate hiking cycle, Middle East tensions and the specter of long-term inflation are nudging investors toward safer harbors, including crypto, as BlackRock’s Larry Fink’s “flight to quality,” comment suggested. Funny how a former crypto-skeptic like Fink is now singing Bitcoin’s praises on national TV, huh?Assuming we’re now out of the deep crypto freeze, where are we in this new cycle? From an analysis of previous Bitcoin cycles using the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), we can see that we could be well on our way to the next cycle highs.From an average of previous cycles, it takes about 700 days between previous cycle lows and new cycle highs, with drawdowns averaging some -80% across cycles. Assuming November 21, 2022 was the previous cycle low, this would imply a new cycle high sometime in Q3 of 2024, with new highs exceeding previous cycle highs (November 9, 2021 was Bitcoin all-time-high of $67k) by a multiple of 2-7 times, assuming the averages of a small sample size of Bitcoin cycles hold and history repeats itself.(Source: CoinDesk Indices)Massive cycle analysis caveats aside, it appears that we’re out of another crypto winter, with the support of a broader institutional adoption narrative and a favorable macroeconomic backdrop.Truly developments to be thankful for this holiday season.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesA change to the mechanics of BlackRock's proposed spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF opens the door for Wall Street banks, which face restrictions holding cryptocurrencies, to play a key role. BlackRock recently made it so authorized participants (APs) – a vital part of the ETF ecosystem – will be able to create new fund shares with cash, rather than only with cryptocurrency. As highly regulated U.S. banks are unable to hold bitcoin themselves, this set-up would enable the likes of JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs – firms with some of the largest balance sheets in the world – to act as APs to BlackRock's ETF. (Whether they want to is another matter.) The cash APs use in this process can then be exchanged into bitcoin by an intermediary and warehoused by the ETF's custody provider, as per a memo filing relating to a Nov. 28 meeting involving the Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock and Nasdaq.Binance, Binance.US and Changpeng Zhao argued that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not meet the requirements of the “Howey Test” in its suit against the two companies and their founder in a new filing Tuesday. Binance and Zhao filed a reply to the SEC alongside Binance.US, which submitted its own separate but similar filing arguing the SEC did not show that the exchanges’ U.S. customers had any contracts that would meet the definition of an “investment contract,” or that other elements of the Supreme Court case were met. It’s the latest bid to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the federal regulator in June, when the SEC alleged that Binance and Binance.US allowed the general public to buy and trade unregistered securities by listing certain cryptocurrencies and offering a staking service.Crypto mogul Justin Sun has said that assets held on HTX and Poloniex are “100% safe” after last month’s hack that saw more than $200 million siphoned out of the exchanges.Both exchanges have opened withdrawals for certain assets, although several altcoins remain locked. Bitcoin (BTC) and Tron (TRX) are the two digital assets that can be withdrawn. This led to both tokens trading at a premium on Poloniex over the past few weeks, which meant users would have to take a haircut of up to 10% to liquidate their asset and withdraw another.The freeze came after hackers stole $114 million out of Poloniex’s hot wallets on Nov. 10; this was followed up by $97 million being stolen from HTX and blockchain protocol Heco Chain.Trending PostsThree Arrows Co-Founder Su Zhu Faces Questioning in Singapore Court in Hunt for Assets: BloombergCantor Fitzgerald CEO Is a Bitcoin Maxi and Tether FanDonald Trump Unveils New 'Mugshot' NFTs, Stirring Up Prices for His Previous NFTsEdited by Sheldon Reback."

However, the digital assets bill was finally introduced in the Legislative Assembly at the end of November 2022, where Bukele’s party, Nuevas Ideas, has a large majority.Sixty-two legislators voted for the law today, and 16 voted against it, and the law was finally passed in January 2021.The development is the second major bitcoin-focused move in as many weeks. Earlier, El Salvador kickstarted its \"Freedom VISA\" program, doling out residency to a maximum of 1,000 people annually who invest at least $1 million worth of bitcoin or tether (USDT) stablecoins.Edited by Shaurya Malwa."

These pullbacks are necessary to unwind excessive leverage for a more sustainable price action, he added.\"BTC just [nearly] doubled in 2 months with no pullbacks, a correction is not that surprising,\" Clemente posted. \"Corrections shake out 'weak hands' and leverage, allowing for a stronger foundation for eventual moves higher.\"The decline wiped out over $520 million in leveraged trading positions on the crypto derivatives market, predominantly longs betting on rising prices, CoinGlass data shows. It was the largest level of daily liquidations in at least three months, according to the firm.Liquidations are forceful closure of a leveraged trading position usually because the trader's margin to cover the open position has run out. Large liquidation events often mark a local top or bottom in prices.Daily crypto liquidations (CoinGlass)Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, noted that the cascading liquidations of leveraged longs intensified the current sell-off as traders faced margin calls. Additionally, a stronger U.S. dollar might have added to the crypto market weakness.He said the pullback helped cryptocurrencies come down from overbought levels, and asset prices could continue to rally to new highs.\"We suspect these dips in bitcoin and ether will be eaten up rather quickly, in favor of higher lows and bullish continuations to new yearly highs,” Kruger said in an emailed note. “The outlook for crypto assets into the year-end remains bright.\"Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Bitcoin is still up over 150% this year, though the massive, sudden and unexpected “red candle” on the charts is a reminder of the largest cryptocurrency’s volatility.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteLast week it seemed like very little could stand in bitcoin’s way, with many of the industry’s long-standing issues seemingly resolved. So why did bitcoin drop today?It might be better to start at why it was climbing in the first place.For instance, Binance, the largest and most controversial crypto exchange, agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine to U.S authorities to keep operating, a “historic” penalty it seems likely to survive. This settlement also cast the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) legal imbroglio with U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken in a better light.The regulatory front in the U.S., generally speaking, also seems to be easing. If there isn’t yet “regulatory clarity,” (that old industry adage), proposals have been made by high-ranking legislators giving a good indication of what’s likely to come.There are also predictable events like Bitcoin’s scheduled “halving” next year, when the network literally cuts the amount of BTC that enters into circulation in half, and the potential the SEC approves a bitcoin ETF application. Market watchers have been talking up both events, and the ETF could be said to be the prime driver of bitcoin’s price recently.Then there are the macroeconomic forecasts. Bitcoin, which is sometimes called “digital gold” because it theoretically could act like a similar store-of-value, has rallied alongside its physical metallic counterpart. Gold futures recently settled at a record end-of-day high, in part driven by inflation concerns.See also: Crypto's Macro Drivers – It's Not Just About BitcoinInterest rates, managed by the Federal Reserve, are at their highest level yet in the 21st century, as the U.S. central bank works to quell inflation and cool an overheated economy. Many experts think the Fed’s work will soon be done, with some saying it may even retrace ground and lower interest rates in the first half of next year.Lowered interest rates are good for bitcoin in the same way it’s good for economic activity, it “makes money cheaper” by making it cheaper to borrow, which means there is more money around, period. Then, because lower interest rates makes safer investments like government bonds less attractive, by lowering the expected return on investment, that capital then has a way of working its way down the risk curve, towards asset classes like crypto.I don’t really know what explains today’s “flash crash,” which began with a market correction on Sunday night. Crypto-related stocks like MARA and RIOT dropped double digits today even as tech-heavy equities exchange Nasdaq is on track to gain on the day.Many, like VDX research lead Greta Yuan, looked to macro forces. On Friday, there was a stronger-than-expected jobs report and the Wall Street Journal’s “Fed Whisperer” Nick Timiraos forecasts that the Fed itself aims to cut rates in 2024. The “minor adjustment” could be explained by “better-than-expected nonfarm payroll and lower unemployment,\" she said.See also: There's Less Money in Crypto, and That's a Good ThingMeanwhile, Lucy Hu, a Metalpha senior analyst, told CoinDesk last night it could be part of a “rational process of profit-taking,” meaning that traders essentially made as much as they wanted and decided to cash out. CoinDesk’s market watcher Omkar Godbole called funding rates in crypto derivatives “overheated.”While the amount of leverage in crypto derivatives markets may not explain the first mover problem of knowing what, if anything, caused a market correction, it certainly does help explain how an asset could drop so far so quickly. Godbole also used phrases like “excess bullish leverage” and “overcrowding of long positions.”When traders are overleveraged, they’re essentially trading borrowed money. That means that they’re helping to inflate asset prices with capital that doesn’t really exist and also that if prices drop they can be wiped out (aka liquidated) with a far bigger impact on the wider market. Leverage is great until it isn’t.What this also means is, for better or worse, the amount of leverage has also been reset to something healthier. And let it be a lesson to you, dear reader, that in crypto, especially when everything seems to be working in your favor, that prices can swing on a hiccup. So be sane, and recognize that volatility cuts both ways…"

Bitcoin fell 3% in the last 24 hours to trade around $42,400 after hitting $45,000 last week. There are a number of factors for the drop in price, with some analysts attributing it to macroeconomic fundamentals. Friday’s economic data from the U.S. came in strong, with better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls and lower employment. The dollar rallied and bitcoin dropped slightly immediately after. The pullback could also stem from investors taking profits after last week's gains.

These capital rotations are typical in the crypto markets after large bitcoin run-ups, followed by a rally in bigger crypto assets then among meme coins and micro caps as traders chase tokens that haven't moved yet to profit.ADA surged 25% to 57 cents at one point during the day, its highest price since August 2022. It gave up some of the early gains later in the day, but was still up almost 20% today. Other notable top performers were native tokens of Polkadot (DOT), Algorand (ALGO), Avalanche (AVAX) and Solana (SOL), which posted 7%-11% gains.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a basket of almost 200 cryptocurrencies, was up 1.5% through the day, more than BTC, underscoring altcoin outperformance.What's next for BTCAs bitcoin's momentum stalled, some analysts speculated about a potential pullback to retest lower price levels.Bitcoin-focused analyst Willy Woo eyed a price level between $39,000-$41,000 based on a price gap in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures market, which BTC might \"fill\" sometime in the future.These price gaps occur because the CME futures market, unlike native crypto exchanges like Binance or Deribit, don't trade around the clock, and there could be a difference between closing and opening prices depending on bitcoin's price action when the market is closed. Some analysts reckon that asset prices tend to revisit these levels during a correction, filling the gap.BTC rallied last weekend surpassing $40,000, when the CME futures market was closed, creating the price gap on the chart.\"By my count 28 out of 30 gaps have been filled on CME daily candles (93%),\" Woo posted on X, formerly Twitter.However, these gaps do not always get filled. For example, BTC hasn't revisited the CME gap at around $20,000 yet, formed in March during the weekend collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).Institutional inflows to bitcoin are \"underappreciated\"Despite a potential short-term pullback, bitcoin's outlook is bullish, with growing interest among institutional investors, Hany Rashwan, co-founder and CEO of digital asset management firm 21.co, said in a Friday interview with CoinDesk TV.UnmuteRashwan opined that market observers are \"underappreciating\" future inflows into BTC if – or once – a spot-based exchange-traded fund gets approved in the U.S, which will likely happen according to analysts.\"There are a lot of [prospective] buyers, who for various reasons wanted to invest in crypto but has been prohibited to do so\" because of regulations, he said. Rashwan noted that 75% of inflows into digital asset funds during the year happened in the past 60-90 days. \"That's not normal,\" he said, adding that it's \"a sign of change in sentiment across primarily institutional players.\"Read more: Crypto Funds Attract Largest Weekly Inflow in 2023 as Bitcoin 'Short-Sellers Capitulate'Rashwan prognosed all-time high prices for bitcoin, but not in the short term.\"I think we will beat the [bitcoin] all-time highs sometime in the next 12-18 months,\" he said. \"We are not fully out of the woods yet.\"Edited by Nikhilesh De."

The nation kickstarted its \"Freedom VISA\" program on Thursday, doling out residency to a maximum of 1,000 people per year who invest at least $1 million worth of bitcoin or tether (USDT) stablecoins. Eligible participants receive a long-term residency permit and have a path to full citizenship.

On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC and one ETH.“Deribit options notional open interest has reached a new ATH with $16 billion in BTC options and $7.6 billion in ETH options outstanding, resulting in a total of $23.6 billion. When adding the $2.2 billion in perpetuals and futures OI, Deribit has for the first time reached the $25 billion milestone (total now $25.8B!),” Strijers told CoinDesk.Options allow investors to take leveraged bets on the underlying asset and hedge their spot/futures market exposure. A call option gives the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A put gives the right to sell.Options trading is three-dimensional, allowing investors to bet on the direction of the price move, the degree of expected price volatility and time. The spot and futures markets are one-dimensional, focusing just on price direction.Therefore, the record options open interest represents an influx of sophisticated traders in the crypto market and promises better price discovery.At press time, most open interest in bitcoin and ether options was concentrated in call options. In bitcoin’s case, a large concentration of open interest is seen in calls at $50,000, $40,000, and $45,000 strikes. In ether’s case, calls at $2,300, $2,400, $2,500 and $3,000 are the most popular.The bias for calls is consistent with the ongoing rally in both cryptocurrencies and suggests expectations for continued upside.Bitcoin topped the $44,000 mark early this week, reaching the highest since April 2022, largely on the back of ETF optimism and receding U.S. Treasury yields. The leading cryptocurrency has gained over 150% this year.Ether neared $2,400 early today, the highest since May 2022, extending the year-to-date gain to 98%.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

In a preliminary trial, the court will be looking to determine whether Tulip does own the bitcoin, according to a High Court of England and Wales order posted on the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund website. The order is dated Nov. 15.Wright, who has long claimed he is bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto – a claim long met with widespread skepticism – sued the developers for refusing to build a backdoor mechanism to help Tulip Trading retrieve the coins it claimed to have owned and lost. The case was originally dismissed in March 2022, but reinstated on appeal.\"Mr. Wright now not only needs to prove that he owns the bitcoin for the claim to proceed, he must also pay security for the developers’ costs of doing so,\" Timothy Elliss, a partner at Enyo Law, which represents most of the defendants, said in an email.The preliminary trial, which is scheduled to take 15 days, will also seek to determine whether the alleged hack occurred and, if so, whether it deprived Tulip Trading of the private keys that controlled the bitcoin, among other issues.The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is an organization funded by, among others, Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter (now X), Bluesky and Block (formerly Square).CoinDesk reached out to Tulip's law firm Shoosmith for comment.

For that, the Federal Reserve would likely need to see a sizable slowdown in employment gains – which are still averaging 212,000 over the past four months – or even one or two negative monthly prints.Economists are expecting Friday's report to show a job gain of 185,000 in November, with the unemployment rate flat from October at 3.9%. A sizable miss to the downside is likely to reinforce bets about lower interest rates and might provide the fuel for bitcoin's run to $50,000. The flip side, however – jobs added of 200,000 or more – might prompt a reversal of those rate cut bets and take a chunk out of bitcoin's recent rally."

That starkly contrasts with past rallies, including the rally in late 2020-early 2021, when pullbacks of 20% or more were common.Those pullbacks have remained elusive this time around, possibly because spot-market buyers have been in the driver's seat.Read more: This Bitcoin Rally Feels Different. FOMO and YOLO Seem to Be Back\"The bull market has been a clearly spot-driven bull market, with all major derivatives data relatively flat, futures premiums holding around 10%, and options IVs [implied volatility] not showing significant gains,\" options data tracking website Greeks.Live said on X. \"We have to put this rally and the news of the impending passage of the ETF in perspective; this spot bull market is very healthy, the downside is limited, and the bull market is here to stay.\"BTC's ongoing rally has been devoid of deep pullbacks that were a norm during previous bull runs. (CoinDesk/TradingView) (CoinDesk/TradingView)A spot market is where an asset is traded for immediate delivery. Derivatives involve futures and options, whose value is derived from the underlying asset, and these instruments are settled in the future.According to CCData, spot and derivatives trading volume on centralized exchanges rose to an eight-month high of $3.61 trillion in November, with the share of derivatives declining for the third straight month to 73%. Data tracked by analytics firm CryptoQuant show bitcoin's spot-to-derivatives trading volume ratio jumped to nearly 0.10 from 0.05 last month, indicating increased activity in the spot market.While derivatives still account for the majority of market volume, the degree of leverage in the system remains low, supporting the stair-step price ascent.Derivatives are usually leveraged instruments, allowing traders to take bullish (long) or bearish (short) positions worth more than the amount they have deposited as a margin at the exchange. Leverage is a double-edged sword, magnifying both profits and losses. It also exposes traders to liquidations, or forced unwinding, due to margin shortfalls. Furthermore, mass liquidations often lead to exaggerated bullish or bearish moves, so the greater the use of leverage, the higher the probability of liquidations injecting volatility into the market.Bitcoin's estimated leverage ratio (CryptoQuant) (CryptoQuant)The estimated leverage ratio, calculated by dividing the dollar value locked in active open perpetual futures contracts by the total value of coins held by derivatives exchanges, remains near April's low of 0.20, having peaked above 0.40 last year, according to data source CryptoQuant.Most leading exchanges, including Binance, now offer 20x or lower leverage in derivatives trading, allowing speculators to establish long positions controlling 20 times the value of their collateral. That's significantly below the 100x available during previous bull runs. Such high use of leverage meant less staying power when things turned bad and vulnerability to liquidations-induced downside volatility, as observed during the 2020-21 bull run.Besides, activity is now more concentrated in standard futures on the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where institutions and sophisticated traders rarely employ extreme leverage. Derivatives trading on the CME rose 18.4% to $67.9 billion in November, the highest in two years, according to CCData. CME also overtook Binance as the largest derivatives exchange, with open interest in BTC rising 21% to $4.11 billion.Lastly, the use of coins as margin for trading peaked in 2021-22. Now, cash or stablecoin-margined contracts account for most of the open interest in BTC futures. Cash-margined contracts offer a linear payoff, while coin-margined contracts, where the collateral is as volatile as the trading position, create a greater liquidation risk.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

These may have contributed to the asset’s strength since the start of this week – a move that has seen it jump to $44,000 from $39,000.Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.Most of these liquidations have occurred on crypto exchanges Binance, OKX and Huobi, data from CoinGlass shows. Trading volumes have surged 25% in the past week, and open interest has grown to $20.2 billion from $17.2 billion at the start of December.Bitcoin open interest has surged in the past week. (Coinglass)Several factors look to be aiding bitcoin growth. There’s optimism around a possible spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S., traders pricing in expected rate cuts in the U.S. – which buoys risky bets such as technology stocks and bitcoin – and possible sovereign adoption as bitcoin-friendly leaders take the helm in major economies.At least one group of traders placed a $200 million BTC futures position over the weekend, as reported, indicative of the high demand for bitcoin exposure. Such moves come alongside continual spot ETF application updates and changes.Some observers expect bitcoin prices to cross the $48,000 level in the coming weeks.“The staging for this rally already started in the week beginning 10/23 when BTC managed to overcome the iron-beam resistance in the $30k area,” shared Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, in a note to CoinDesk. “On the weekly chart, the next expected level of resistance is around $48k, the peak set at the end of March 2022.”“All in all, the trend for BTC is clearly up, with a first target around $48,000 and support near $38,000,” he added.Edited by Omkar Godbole."

The performance gap is even wider in larger time frames, with bitcoin boasting a 163% gain on a year-to-date basis versus ether's 89%.The chasm could narrow as money is now flowing into ether futures faster than bitcoin. The notional open interest, or the dollar-value locked in Chicago Mercantile Exchange's cash-settled ether futures contract, has increased by 30% to $711 million in the past five days, beating bitcoin's 19% growth to $4.9 billion, according to Velo Data. CME's ETH standard futures contract is sized at 50 ETH while its bitcoin counterpart is sized at 5 BTC.The emerging positive spread between pricing for ether and bitcoin CME futures suggests the same. Per Reflexivity Research, the premium in ether futures relative to the spot index price was 5% higher than in bitcoin early this week.\"The futures basis (which represents the difference between the spot and futures price) for Ethereum on CME is now trading at a 5% premium to that of bitcoin, now over 20%. In addition, we can see that open interest for ETH on the CME has now started to rise, after lagging the initial move up from bitcoin,\" Reflexivity Research said in a market update dated Dec. 5.\"It may be too early to definitely say, but it appears 'tradfi' may be beginning to rotate into the ETH ETF trade after two months. This is something to continue monitoring for early signs of the market beginning to front-run a potential ETH ETF,\" Reflexivity Research said.Basis refers to the spread between futures and spot prices. (Velo Data) (Velo Data)Meanwhile, in the options market listed on Deribit, traders have started to lean toward ether calls and bitcoin puts. A call option offers the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buy is bearish.Per Amberdata, the one-month ether call-put skew, which measures the spread between implied volatility premium or demand for call and put options expiring in four weeks, has doubled to over 4% this month, a sign of strengthening call bias. Meanwhile, BTC's one-month skew has declined from 5% to 2%, a sign that traders are beginning to lean toward puts relative to calls.Perhaps bitcoin may take a breather, allowing ether to play catch up in the weeks ahead.Edited by Shaurya Malwa."

Memory usage has also surged past the 300mb alloted, because of the larger size or inscription transactions versus regular transactions.\"Bitcoin Core has, since 2013, allowed users to set a limit on the size of extra data in transactions they relay or mine (`-datacarriersize`). By obfuscating their data as program code, Inscriptions bypass this limit,\" Dashjr continued.Back in May, when Ordinals first became popular, Binance had to temporarily pause bitcoin withdrawals after the network became overwhelmed and the number of unconfirmed transactions spiked to 400,000.While Ordinals have their critics, like Dashjr, there's also an equally large camp that says they are an evolution of Bitcoin's blockchain.Jason Fang, managing partner and co-founder at Bitcoin-heavy Sora Ventures, disagrees and argues that Bitcoin maintains its original consensus with innovations built on top, suggesting Satoshi's open-source approach encouraged experimentation.\"Inscriptions are unstoppable,\" he said. \"This gives miners more fees and higher profits.\"At the depths of last year's crypto winter, many miners needed to be bailed out, being hit hard by a nasty trifecta of a low price of bitcoin, and increasing difficulty.Miners, both private and publicly listed, faced margin calls and defaults as they struggled with debts up to $4 billion, used for building large facilities in North America, CoinDesk reported last year.Fang explains part of the animosity towards inscriptions because many are upset due to the attention and profits garnered by Ordinals and other BRC-20 investments – and they missed out.UPDATE (Dec. 6, 8:21 UTC): Removes duplicated textEdited by Shaurya Malwa."

BTC sank toward $15,000 in the aftermath of FTX's blow-up.It was ugly. You probably remember!Prices have rebounded throughout 2023, but much of it felt like hard-won gains – rallies were quickly followed by setbacks. By mid-October, bitcoin was around $27,000.And then the market caught fire, fueled by optimism over bitcoin ETFs and sinking interest rates. Bitcoin just briefly touched $45,000 on Coinbase. It had only just managed to surpass $40,000 a few days ago, a level last seen in early 2022.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Famed Bull-Market Pullbacks Have Been Elusive During the Recent Price SurgeBitcoin's price since 2021 (CoinDesk)A crypto-skeptic friend texted me Tuesday saying he was about to buy more bitcoin. A colleague says he's hearing from people wondering about crypto. Will this last? Is crypto making a move toward mainstream territory again?To the disappointment of my father, who has asked me for forecasts throughout my two-decade career covering markets and finance, I have no idea. But I know it's been two years since the mood in crypto markets felt this ebullient – before the collapses of Celsius, Voyager, Three Arrows Capital, FTX, Genesis …FOMO (you know, \"fear of missing out\") maybe mixed with a dose of YOLO (\"you only live one\") seems to be back.Wall Street is coming to cryptoHow things got this enthusiastic is not hard to fathom. It really is a big deal that Wall Street heavyweights BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton are trying to list bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.Click here to read CoinDesk's Most Influential list for 2023, a series of 50 profiles of key people in crypto, including BlackRock's Larry Fink and Franklin Templeton's Jenny Johnson.Anyone with a plain vanilla brokerage account should be able to buy these products, if they're approved by regulators – and all signs point to approval being likely soon. That's easier and probably more realistic for regular Americans than setting up a Coinbase account or, heaven forbid, figuring out how a decentralized exchange or MetaMask work.So, BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton's sales and marketing heft looks poised to be behind bitcoin ETFs. It's not crazy to think that will bring a lot of money into crypto. Whether that creates a sustainable rally is up for debate.Here's what else is on my mind:A ROCKY DEBUT: After FTX fell apart, many folks wondered if something bad was going to happen to its bigger rival, Binance. U.S. regulators and law enforcement seemed to be circling. We got our answer recently: The crypto exchange agreed to pay $4.3 billion to settle several U.S. investigations. Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao stepped down as CEO. For all the angst in the run-up to this, though, the industry has taken it in stride. Anyway, CZ's replacement, Richard Teng, just had his first big public interview, and it was not a smooth debut, according to CoinDesk's Helene Braun. He came across as evasive. The company never says where it's based, and Teng was opaque about that and other issues. The question is whether this matters. Maybe traders don't care if the world's biggest crypto exchange is evasive?CRYPTO'S BEST CORRELATION: It's become a cliché: Elon Musk says or does something, and it moves the price of dogecoin (DOGE), the meme coin he's long loved. It just happened again. A regulatory filing shows he's trying to raise $1 billion for his AI efforts. DOGE immediately surged. One of the strangest correlations in markets persists."

The two-year Treasury yield is at 4.60%, down more than 50 basis points from the start of that month.The big drops came as market participants began to price in an end to the U.S. Federal Reserve's 18-month run of tighter monetary policy. Traders didn't stop at that, though: Short-term rate markets now anticipating that the Fed will start cutting rates as soon as the first quarter of 2024.There's now about a two-thirds chance of one or more 25-basis-point Fed rate cuts by March 2024, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which draws its data from those short-term rate markets. Going out to May, markets have priced in just shy of a 90% chance of one or more rate cuts, including about a 5% chance of three rate cuts by that time.To the extent that sharply tighter monetary policy throughout 2022 was a factor in bitcoin's major bear market that year, now-entrenched expectations of easier policy in 2024 are surely playing a role in this bull move. And it's not just bitcoin.Read more: U.S. CPI Unexpectedly Flat in October; Bitcoin Adds Nearly 1%The 180-degree turn in the rate outlook is lifting assets across the board.

Perpetual futures traded at around 5-10% premium versus the spot price for most of the year, which widened to 10-15%, with sometimes hitting 20-30%, the report explained.\"This shows panic buying from traders who are closing out shorts or increasing leveraged longs,\" Matrixport analysts said.Investors show no sign of stopping throwing money into crypto funds, according to the lastest fund flows report from asset manager CoinShares.

        "content": "Lisa Neigut is a bitcoiner's bitcoiner. First of all, she's from the maverick state of Texas. She uses the Lightning Network, which she helped build. She's teaching people the world over how to sync a node, and raising funds in sats to do it. And she's writing a textbook about bitcoin transactions.The first time I spoke to Neigut, she said \"If you really want to get my attention, you can message me for a small fee on VIDA,\" a screener for spam that only lets paid messages through. In this industry, you call that proof-of-work.This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.But given her bona fides, Neigut is also something of a late convert to bitcoin – at least compared to the OGs who remember conversing with Satoshi on BitcoinTalk in 2010. She said she bought her first couple thousand satoshis in 2018 using CashApp (as any bitcoiner would).That same year Neigut started working at Blockstream as a developer. Before that she was predominantly an Android app developer, with her first dev job working on a mobile app for Etsy – particularly \"the in-app cart.\"\"I've been working in different aspects of 'ecommerce' almost my entire dev career,\" Neigut said in an email interview.To some extent that remains the case. At Blockstream, Neigut is helping to develop Lightning, a scalable payments layer for Bitcoin that makes the cryptocurrency fast and cheap enough to use BTC for buying things like your morning cup of coffee.Lightning has its issues, and Neigut is focused on fixing them. Although not yet an industry-standard term, Neigut has been working on what she calls \"Lightning v2,\" or version two, since 2019 to make it easier to move money around on the payments-focused protocol.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, is sometimes derided for being slow to adopt new innovations, a point Neigut contends. At Consensus 2023, for instance, she said the largest blockchain (by market capitalization) is poised for a \"Cambrian explosion\" of layer 2s that will accelerate adoption and development of the chain, including the one she's working on.And, as of writing in late November, it's \"days away from being merged into the spec.\" Kudos, Neigut. Though she isn't one to hog the spotlight:\"The best part of working at Blockstream for almost half a decade has been getting to work with Rusty Russell and Christian Decker, two rightfully legendary bitcoin devs. When I got hired onto the Lightning team, Rusty joked that I was the diversity hire because I program in vim (he and Christian Decker are emacs users),\" she said, referring to different text editing systems.Despite 2023 looking like the year Neigut will finish what it took four years to develop, she said she actually spent most of her time writing (and procrastinating from writing) the above-mentioned textbook.Neigut is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, where she also worked as a teaching assistant in the McCombs Business School. The year she discovered Bitcoin, 2018, she worked for several months as a coder at Square.Since 2021, she has been running Base58, a Bitcoin education company that hosts in-person and online workshops. This year, Base58 added two new classes on Taproot (a Bitcoin code update) and Lightning, and hosted several conferences called bitcoin++, including its first in Europe.Q&AWhat was your biggest achievement this past year?Getting interop[ability] with Eclair [a bitcoin wallet] for the first phase of what I'm calling \"Lightning v2.\" We're extremely close to having it merged [into the codebase], which would be my biggest contribution to the official Lightning specifications.It's something I started working on in 2019, so it's really rewarding to have reached this point with the protocol!(There's three phases to Lightning v2: v2 opens also known as \"dual-funding,\" splicing, and \"splice to close.\" As of right now, the first two phases (v2 opens and splicing) are implemented in Core Lightning and Eclair; v2 opens are days away from being merged into the spec. These are really cool and important updates to Lightning because they allow for cheaper and more dynamic movement of on-chain bitcoin between existing and new Lightning channels.)Other achievements include: ran my fourth ever bitcoin++ conference in 16 months, first ever in Europe; and launched two new classes for Base58 (Taproot + Lightning).What's your No. 1 goal for 2024?Level up 5,000 more devs into bitcoin protocols with Base58 courses (online or in person).Please give us a prediction for crypto next year.Bitcoin dominance reaches new heights, Tether gets adopted by the USG as the new Fed.

It's not that Rodarmor is looking to anger; he simply found something that he thought needed doing. Unfortunately, many of his contemporaries have simply not caught up.If you're not up to speed: This year, Rodarmor, a long-time Bitcoiner who has made actual code commits to Bitcoin Core, unveiled what he calls Ordinals Theory. In popular parlance, Ordinals are often referred to as \"NFTs on Bitcoin.\" It's a phrase that might make Rodarmor, a California native, with as sunny a disposition as he can be ornery, shudder.This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.Click here to view and bid on the NFT created by Rhett Mankind.

Holders of a Most Influential NFT will receive a Pro Pass ticket to Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas. To learn more about Consensus, click here.\"It's one of the worst acronyms I've ever heard,\" Rodarmor said, referring to the initialism for non-fungible tokens, in an interview in early November. \"First of all, it's very financial for something that is, like, actually interesting and artistic. And then you tell them what the acronym stands for and they don't know what it means. Fungible? And then it's a negation. It's just terrible.\"He said he strives to use \"evocative, interesting language\" that \"accurately describes\" what he's talking about. That's why his preferred term for \"Bitcoin NFTs\" is \"digital artifacts.\" At times, you might also hear terms like \"inscriptions,\" or \"rare sats\" (short for satoshis, the smallest denomination of BTC) or \"digital art objects.\"I don't mean to be a massive pedantic a--hole.Casey Rodarmor\"I don't mean to be a massive pedantic a--hole,\" he said. But language matters to the high school dropout. His mother is an author and his father a former editor at PC World Magazine. He grew up with words counting for something and a lot of computers around, though he didn't learn how to code until he mostly taught himself later in life.\"Personally it kind of irks me, but I can't do anything about it, that people don't distinguish between ordinals and inscriptions,\" he said.Indeed, what is the difference? It might be best to start at the beginning.Bitcoin Ordinals vs. inscriptionsFirst, there was Bitcoin, the distributed computing network that ushered in a private, digital currency called bitcoin into the world. Bitcoin can be sent peer-to-peer, or directly, without an intermediary. It is a protocol and a currency that many users, including Rodarmor, like because there is a finite number of bitcoins (21 million). Altogether, this means Bitcoin is resistant to censorship and inflation.\"I don't really have a 'hard money' or 'gold bug' background. But I think it would probably be good if we had money that didn't inflate,\" Rodarmor, born in 1983, said. He added that he became politically aware in his 20s, and that he thinks \"the government is incompetent … because they have bad incentives.\"Bitcoiners rejoice. You may not like to hear it, but Rodarmor is one of you.Indeed, many Bitcoiners this year described Rodarmor as an enemy of Bitcoin, because of the Ordinals Protocol he built that allows people to \"inscribe\" data onto bitcoins. This, Ordinals critics allege, breaks the fungibility of bitcoin (in a similar way that if a coin is badly scratched, some people may not want to cash it), reduces privacy (a marked coin is an identifier) and clutters the chain (NFTs have a reputation for being frivolous junk).Rodarmor, obviously, disagrees. He used to be far more willing to engage with critics and to try to educate them. For instance, in a Q&A on the Stacker News forum in January, shortly after Ordinals launched, he responded to a question raised about how inscriptions will interfere with bitcoin's exchangeability.That a marked sat is less fungible \"is probably sort of true,\" he wrote, \"but it's not actually a problem in practice, since everyone can just ignore ordinal numbers and inscriptions.\" Ordinals Theory is essentially just a \"lens\" for properly ordering satoshis in order to view inscriptions, that is, should anyone choose to \"inscribe\" a \"digital art object\" onto a satoshi.\"Satoshis are uninscribed when they come into the world, unstamped metal rounds that can be pressed into a coin,\" Rodarmor said in a podcast in March.In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, added a similar feature to Ordinals in one of the protocol's early codebases. Although it was eventually removed, former Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin found an \"atoms\" function that would doctor up a random bitcoin once per block, which would make a scarce asset even more scarce.Bitcoin's Taproot updateLikewise, contrary to popular belief, the Ordinals protocol could have been built for Bitcoin beginning on \"day one,\" Rodarmor said. It has become common wisdom that the ability to \"inscribe\" these assets was only unlocked after the so-called Taproot update last year, which created a new transaction type for the network.The Taproot upgrade helped, but the Ordinals protocol was always possible, if only someone had the idea.Meet Rhett Mankind, the artist who created the image of Casey Rodarmor for Most Influential 2023. Rodarmor's inspiration came from his interest in generative art, work that is created autonomously using prefabricated algorithms, which has taken on a particular life of its own within the NFT scene, and his desire to create his own generative artworks.Although he was quite taken by some of the artists working on Ethereum, in particular \"Art Blocks\" creator Erick Calderon, when he went to code his own smart contract on the system, he walked away feeling disgusted. \"Terrible usability,\" he said.So he decided to make his own version on Bitcoin. \"The idea behind this project was like 'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if I can make and sell my own digital art? And so, you know, of course, I got massively sidetracked\" building the protocol, he said. The plan is still to generate art eventually, but at the time of our interview he said he had made \"a grand total of one inscription.\"He said these types of all-consuming projects have happened in the past. About a decade ago, for instance, he started working on a musical instrument that used capacitive sensors and a microcomputer that you could play with your hands, not unlike a theremin.\"I went through this whole fabrication phase where I was making silicone pads with embedded conductive fabrics and using a laser cutter to get these different shapes of metal and pouring rubber molds to make control surfaces…\" he said. He said he hasn't touched the instrument since.There was also a phase where he was making visuals for electronic music, programming everything from \"scratch.\" Most recently, he's been making pottery.Rodarmor said he's especially attracted to art that serves a purpose; if something is purely \"conceptual,\" he said it can be boring. At the same time, however, his favorite works are \"large-scale, abstract metal sculpture.\" Essentially anything that is austere and geometric.Though he never said as much, it's clear that coding for Rodarmor is a type of art. Or at least it can be an artistic process. In fact, he described his \"processes\" for creating spinning pottery wheels and coding trance-like visuals in almost the exact same way.\"It's about sitting there and writing an algorithm and tweaking it over and over and over again until you get something new,\" he said.Code can obviously be functional, and, in most cases, it is. Software development has essentially been Rodarmor's only job over the years (outside of a stint of odd jobs working at a clothing store call Mr. Rags, as a film projectionist in Berkeley and video game tester around the time the Gameboy Advance came out before he got California's version of a GED). He worked for a stint at Google, and later at Chaincode Labs.Ordinals, for him, was a labor of love. He had saved up a bit of a nest egg working his previous tech jobs that allowed him to fund development. He told me, and has said in other interviews, he's received tips in bitcoin, but he's not sure if that \"took him out of the red.\"And while Ordinals has been uniquely successful – at time of writing, there have been more than 45 million inscriptions made, generating just under $1 billion in total fees on the Bitcoin network, according to data on Dune Analytics – it can often feel like unappreciated work.This summer, Rodarmor essentially went dark. After doing months of interviews (including for this publication) and podcasts and reaping the hate of Bitcoiners who despise Ordinals on social media, he felt like he needed to step back. At the time, he said, he wasn't sure if he'd return.Part of the issue was just the fundamental unseriousness of the conflict. Bitcoin is an open-source project that anyone can adapt, and Ordinals is a protocol that you can choose to use or not. Getting mad at Rodarmor is as pointless as getting mad at BlackRock for \"corrupting\" the ethos of Bitcoin by applying to launch an ETF.Plus, before Ordinals there was no convincing use for Bitcoin that would generate the fees that will eventually be necessary to pay for the network's \"security\" once the \"subsidy\" runs out. Every \"digital art object\" inscribed on-chain means fees are going into miners' pockets, who pay for the specialized chips and electricity that keep Bitcoin humming.\"The most interesting thing with ordinals is forcing bitcoin to reckon with the 'is blockspace solely for native transactions' debate,\" Castle Island Venture partner Nic Carter said in a direct message. \"If the NFT community embraces Ordinals as a top-3 NFT system, I could see it being a meaningful share of Bitcoin's long-term block space, say 20% over long periods.\"The 'Mad Max of capitalism'This is the case whether you view inscriptions as art or junk. But in either case, Bitcoin was created to be a free-for-all, the \"Mad Max of capitalism,\" as Rodarmor said, meaning that if you can pay, you can play and use the blockchain for whatever you want.This is to say nothing of the legitimate technical advantage the Ordinals Theory represents for NFTs. In almost all cases, on other chains, NFTs are just blockchain signatures appended to media without that media being appended to the blockchain. There have already been cases where an NFT project was lost after the website hosting the content has gone down.That's partially why a few NFT projects, including the highly influential Bored Apes series by Yuga Labs, have recreated themselves on Bitcoin. OnChainMonkeys went a step further and abandoned its original series that initially launched on Ethereum.\"Due to their longevity, inscriptions [may] become the first digital form of high art, and the most important form of digital art ever created,\" Rodarmor wrote in the Q&A interview shortly after Ordinals launched.To be sure, Ordinals are not without their problems. Part of the reason Rodarmor re-emerged from his sabbatical this fall was because a massive flaw with how some ordinals are indexed was uncovered. It was the result of a mistake he made while coding the project, and because Ordinals is immutable it cannot be changed.Rodarmor calls affected inscriptions \"cursed\" and initially proposed a way to \"bless them\" by renumbering the assets, in the first blog he published upon his return. This idea caused rancor among collectors who bought or created inscriptions specifically for their \"rare\" placement in the Ordinals register.He and Raphjaph, the developer to whom Rodarmor handed off the ORD protocol, instead decided to address the issue for all inscriptions going forward but not retroactively. The whole process of making a mistake in public code and then working to address the issue by taking on feedback from users is something new for Rodarmor.It's also been an \"iterative process\" learning to live with the love and hate of launching such an influential and contentious bit of software. Rodarmor said he's an avid attendee of Bitcoin Meetups, and that in person most Bitcoiners either love the idea of Ordinals or are indifferent. It's only online where the scale and anonymity of the feedback can be overwhelming.\"Casey is the most knowledgeable bitcoiner I've ever met, He literally knows everything about bitcoin and has been obsessed with it for like a decade,\" Erin Redwing, co-host of Rodarmor's podcast \"Hell Money,\" said in a text message. \"He would never self-describe this way, btw. He's very humble.\"Indeed, a BIP, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, Rodarmor applied for Ordinals still has not been accepted by Bitcoin Core developers, even though it is not making a formal change to the codebase, just a way to formally document \"what has already happened,\" he said. He laughs about it nowadays.\"I'm the kind of person that if I'm not working on something, I'm often bored and kind of depressed,\" he said \"So being back working on it makes me happy.\"Trust the process.Edited by Ben Schiller."

Setting opposing positions helps traders collect a fixed return as the premium evaporates over time and converges with the spot price on the futures contract’s expiry date, irrespective of the spot market trend.Front-month, three-month and longer-dated futures contracts listed on Deribit traded at an annualized premium of 8% to 12% at press time. In other words, a trader setting a cash and carry strategy today can expect an 8% to 12% return (excluding trading costs) from the mispricing in the two markets.“The cash-carry basis trade, a standout in the 2020/2021 bull market, is hinting at a resurgence. Currently, the futures basis is hovering near YTD highs, around 10%,” crypto quant researcher Samneet Chepal told CoinDesk.The basis trade now offers a notably higher return compared to the so-called risk-free rate of 4.2% offered by the U.S. 10-year Treasury note. That said, the spread between yields on the basis trade and the 10-year note is nowhere close to what we saw in early 2021 when three-month BTC futures traded at a premium of 40% and the 10-year note yielded around 1.5%. But things could improve, assuming BTC extends the recent bull run.\"This could be just the beginning. With ETF news expected in early Q1 next year, we might see these numbers climb even higher, potentially surpassing previous cycle highs,\" Chepal added.Premiums surge across the future curve. (Deribit) (Deribit)All else being equal, futures contracts typically trade at a premium to the spot price, and the premium widens during bull runs. Bitcoin has risen 54% since Oct. 1, for several reasons, including the expected launch of one or more spot-based exchange-traded funds in the U.S.Deribit attributes this surge to a confluence of factors, including widespread optimism in anticipation of the pending ETF decision, easing concerns following the settlement of Binance’s legal matters, escalating geopolitical tensions, and the steady increase in institutional engagement, the exchange’s Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk.“Another supporting sign is the futures basis rising beyond 10%, a strong indicator of current market sentiment,” Strijers said.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Analysts disagree, however, on whether approval will subdue bitcoin's notorious price volatility, which has dented its appeal as a haven asset.While the Bitcoin blockchain is decentralized, its token, BTC, is concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of owners, known as whales. Because of the size of their holdings, these whales hold great influence over prices, often triggering violent swings. A spot ETF, which is supposed to track the value of the underlying assets closely, could trim their influence by broadening the owner base.\"A spot ETF would provide bitcoin exposure to a much wider swath of market participants, including institutional investors and financial advisors,\" Nate Geraci, the president of registered investment adviser The ETF Store, said in an interview conducted over direct messaging on X. \"A deeper pool of bitcoin investors via the ETF wrapper could theoretically help lower volatility since there would be a greater number and diversity of investors. That should make it more difficult for larger bitcoin whales to push prices around.\"According to estimates from Galaxy Digital, the addressable market size of a U.S. bitcoin ETF could be $14 trillion in just one year after the spot ETF launch, and $39 trillion in the third year.More liquiditySuch a strong uptake could boost liquidity in the underlying asset, ensuring less volatile trading conditions where prices don't fluctuate rapidly. Liquidity refers to the ability of a market to absorb large orders at stable prices.\"Volatility tends to drop as the space matures, more institutional liquidity and infrastructure develops, and the asset acclimates to normalcy,\" Richard Rosenblum, co-founder and president at crypto liquidity provider GSR, said over Telegram.In the equity markets, an increase in ETF ownership tends to boost liquidity in the underlying stocks, according to a 2018 paper by Mehmet Saglam, associate professor of finance at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business at the University of Cincinnati; Tugkan Tuzun, an economist at the Federal Reserve Board and Russ Wermers, associate professor of finance at the Smith School of Business.\"Using several measures of liquidity, we find that ETFs increase the liquidity of their underlying stocks. We find that illiquidity measures, eﬀective spreads, quoted spreads, Amihud, and implementation shortfall all increase when the ETF ownership of the stock goes down,\" according to the paper, which examined S&P 500 and Nasdaq stocks.\"Examining the price dynamics over large order executions, we find that one primary channel of higher liquidity is due to arbitrageurs trading against potential mispricings between the ETF and the basket of underlying stocks,\" the paper said.Arbitrageurs take offsetting positions in two markets to profit from pricing differences between them. For instance, if an ETF trades at a discount to the value of the underlying stocks, an arbitrageur will buy the ETF and sell underlying stocks, effectively adding liquidity to the underlying assets.Volatility due to cash creationLaurent Kssis, an ETF expert and crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, takes the opposing position, arguing that spot ETFs could become a source of BTC price volatility.ETFs are created and redeemed in kind or in cash. The widely used in-kind creation involves authorized participants (APs) depositing a basket of securities with the issuer in exchange for new ETF units. Under cash creation, APs provide cash and the issuer purchases the actual asset.According to Kssis, in cash creation, the issuer is exposed to the difference between the prices at which assets have been acquired and the daily reference price at which the net asset value (NAV) is calculated.\"We need a reference price where we audit the fund to calculate the NAV,\" Kssis said in a Telegram interview. \"With in-kind creations, APs purchase assets and deliver them to the issuer. With cash creations, if the issuer manages to buy them cheaper, then it makes a little profit, but if it buys them higher, it coughs up the excess.\"\"Hence, at the time of fixing, you will have more arbitrageurs trading around that time channel and creating volume to either push the market or trade discrepancies between the cash and futures price of bitcoin, effectively creating volatility inadvertently during that period,\" Kssis added.Recently, there were rumors on the X that the SEC wants the ETF applicants to work through cash creation.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Usually, futures markets are in contango, a term used to describe when the price of futures rises above spot, with further-out futures drawing higher than nearer-expiration futures. An increase in buying pressure often causes the contango to widen.BTC and ETH futures have recently experienced the same, with the so-called \"next-month\" contract trading at a notable premium to the \"front month\" contract, a rare occurrence since 2018, according to data tracked by K33 Research. The front month contract has an expiration date closest to the current date, while the next in line is called the next month contract.\"It's telling of a very bullish sentiment on CME with a strong desire to add long exposure, leading yields [premiums] to surge,\" Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, told CoinDesk.The CME futures in consideration are sized at five BTC and 50 ETH, respectively. As of writing, December expiry contracts could be called the front month contracts while those expiring in January represent the next month contracts. November contracts expired Monday.The elevated next-month premium indicates bullish sentiment. (K33 Research) (K33 Research)The rolling weekly spread between next and front month BTC and ETH contracts recently widened to an annualized 1.5%, the first such instance since the bull market days of early 2021.The pattern has occurred only four times to date, with three of those seen during bull runs while one a couple of weeks before the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020.According to Lunde, contango in both markets slightly narrowed on Monday but continued to signal a bullish sentiment.\"Yesterday saw a considerable narrowing in the contango. 7,000 BTC worth of open interest was closed on the December contract, and for ETH, last week's build-up to an all-time high notional open interest was erased after seeing a pattern similar to BTC,\" Lunde said.\"Yields [premiums] remain well into the double digits, i.e., CME's sentiment remains very bullish,\" Lunde added.Pear Protocol's founder Huf said that the recent widening of the contango stemmed from traditional market players taking bullish bets.\"It indicates TradFi has a long exposure but not via spot - it's quite a vulnerable positioning - probably gets unwound on any spikes higher into a potential spot ETF approval,\" Huf told CoinDesk.Huf added that elevated futures premiums could see renewed interest in basis trades or cash and carry arbitrage. The strategy involves buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market and simultaneously selling futures. The strategy, one of the most preferred during the 2020-2021 bull run, allows traders to pocket the premium while bypassing price volatility.Edited by Oliver Knight."

The fund has traded at a discount since February 2021 and hit record lows near 50% last December. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that the narrowing is likely prompted by Grayscale's \"updated filings/SEC meeting reported Wed.\"The U.S. Department of Justice doesn't want Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao locked up until sentencing, but does want him to stay in the U.S., arguing in a new filing that he's a \"flight risk that could be managed.\" Late last week, CZ's counsel argued that the very fact he – a non-U.S. citizen holding UAE and Canadian passports – voluntarily entered the U.S. to appear before a court indicates that he's not a flight risk. \"Based on all the relevant facts, including Mr. Zhao's voluntary self-surrender, his intent to resolve this case, and the sizable bail package he proposed, Judge Tsuchida found that Mr. Zhao presents no risk of flight, even while residing in the UAE,\" last week's filing said.News that Metaco, the Swiss digital assets custody firm acquired by Ripple earlier this year, is working with HSBC, one of the world's largest banks, quickly became a reason to be cheerful for many supporters of the U.S. fintech’s ledger protocol, known collectively as the \"XRP army.\" Named after the cryptocurrency designed to move liquidity around the XRP Ledger used by Ripple, these avid fans interpret HSBC’s choice of custody tech partner as yet another sign that financial institutions will inevitably adopt XRPL and, crucially, the XRP token. The crypto space is ferociously tribal. Token holders want to believe their blockchain of choice will rise to prominence and deliver a windfall – sometimes to a point that defies logic. For instance, the assumption that Ripple’s recent acquisition spurred HSBC’s decision ignores the fact that Metaco had been courting the bank for over 18 months, according to Adrien Treccani, the Swiss custody firm’s CEO.Chart of the DayThe notional open interest, or the dollar value locked, in bitcoin's cash-settled futures trading on the CME has topped the $4 billion mark for the first time in at least a year.Open interest has nearly doubled since early October, indicating renewed institutional investor activity.CME replaced Binance as the biggest exchange for BTC standard futures early this month.- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsBitcoin Eyes $40K After Breaching $38K for First Time Since May 2022Tether, Bitfinex to Drop Opposition to New York Freedom of Information Law RequestIs Binance Big Enough to Survive a $4.3B Fine and Founder CZ’s Ousting?Edited by Sheldon Reback."

A weaker greenback often incentivizes risk-taking in crypto and traditional markets.If there is one thing that both crypto and traditional markets love unconditionally, it is cheap fiat liquidity. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the world's most powerful central bank, is likely to take steps in that direction next year.The Fed is priced to be the most dovish among advanced nation central banks in 2024, with traders anticipating at least 100 basis points – or 1 percentage point – of interest-rate cuts from the current 5.25% to 5.5% range, according to Deutsche Bank Research. That will dent the U.S. dollar's appeal as a relatively high-yielding asset.According to ING, the U.S. economy and the inflation rate are expected to slow next year, allowing the Fed to pursue a looser monetary policy.Bank of America, in its Nov. 19 World at Glance report, said the tide is turning for the greenback and \"it can start to adjust broadly lower towards equilibrium\" next year.\"While we still envision the U.S. performing relatively well next year vis-à-vis other major economies, the prospect of an eventual economic landing and corresponding Fed easing, even alongside easing elsewhere, should provide broad relief to currencies across the globe,\" Bank of America's strategists said.A weaker dollar often becomes a tailwind to risk assets, including bitcoin, as occurred in the second half of 2020 and early 2021. The greenback is a global reserve currency, playing an outsized role in global trade and non-bank borrowing. When the dollar strengthens, it causes financial tightening worldwide, disincentivizing risk-taking. The opposite is true when it weakens.The Fed is expected to cut more than any other advanced nation central bank. (Deutsche Bank research) (Deutsche Bank research)The chart shows that most advanced national central banks, led by the Fed, are expected to cut rates next year, having lifted them rapidly in the past 18-20 months to tame inflation.The coordinated easing could compensate for potential rate hikes by the Bank of Japan, which has been touted as a significant source of uncertainty for crypto and traditional markets. The Japanese central bank has been slowly moving away from its ultra-easy monetary policy this year, although its benchmark rate remains below zero.Note that heightened expectations for easing mean there's scope for disappointment and a sharp dollar rally should inflation rebound.\"There are several 'known unknown' scenarios that in aggregate imply a notable risk to our base-case [of weak USD],\" Bank of America's strategists said. \"We identify an upside growth/inflation driven rate shock originating in the U.S., a supply-driven upward oil price shock, and a downward growth shock from China as the most visible among them.\"Edited by Sheldon Reback."

The bank estimates a net $2.5 billion has flowed into GBTC since the start of the year, increasing to $2.7 billion if adding the covering of short interest. “Assuming this buying flow was mostly speculative in anticipation of GBTC being converted to an ETF, then it is likely that this $2.7b would come out of GBTC as these investors take profit once GBTC gets converted,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.A court in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, approved the extradition of Terra founder Do Kwon to either South Korea or the United States, according to an update posted on the judiciary's website.

That does not necessarily mean the uptrend is over.In fact, a closer look at how prices have behaved during the consolidation suggests it isn't.While the gains have been capped closer to $38,000, the subsequent pullbacks have been shallow and short-lived, a sign of persistent \"buy-the-dip\" demand within the price consolidation.

Founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao pleaded guilty in Seattle to charges he personally faced, agreeing to pay a $50 million fine and step down as CEO. Richard Teng, a former Abu Dhabi regulator and later Binance's regional markets head, will replace him. Binance was accused of failing to maintain a proper anti-money laundering program, operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and violating sanctions law, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday.Binance's initial growth was illegally fueled by its U.S. clients, the charging document alleged. In its early days, the exchange relied on Americans for the bulk of its revenue, its trading activity and thus its status as the world's largest crypto exchange. The filing details years of compliance failures and obfuscation in the name of protecting those most valuable – and off-limits – users. But servicing those customers wasn't legal because Binance wasn't a registered U.S. business, according to the government. Binance targeted growth in the country, especially among \"VIP\" users who drove the exchange's trading volume and thus its revenue, helping it become a crypto-trading juggernaut. According to the government, Binance's executives \"tracked and monitored\" the exchange's U.S. performance and even touted their success. As much as 30% of the exchange's web traffic (and just as much revenue) originated in the U.S. in early 2018, the filing said.Following the news, Binance saw over $950 million in net outflows over the past 24 hours. “There are constant hourly net outflows of bitcoin and stablecoins after the CZ's resignation announcement,” Hochan Chung, head of marketing at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. “However, compared to the total reserves of Binance, the current volume is not yet significant at all.” Binance is set to continue operating as usual and make a \"complete exit\" from the U.S market. The withdrawals are above average, but not unusually large on a weekly basis, an analysis of net hourly flows from CryptoQuant shows.

It has, however, impacted Binance's order book liquidity, complicating trading conditions for large traders.Liquidity for top cryptocurrencies on the exchange, measured by 0.1% and 1% market depth indicators, has declined by 25% or more to less than $150 million and around $180 million, respectively, in the past 24 hours, data tracked by Kaiko show. Market depth is a collection of buy and sell orders within a certain percent of the mid-price, or the average of the bid and the ask prices.In other words, moving the market by 0.1% and 1% in either direction is now 25% easier than it was 24 hours ago. It also means trading large orders on Binance at stable prices has become tougher, exposing so-called whales to slippage, that is movement between the price quoted when a trader places the order and what they actually pay when the order is filled.As of now, it's still being determined whether the liquidity has moved to other exchanges.The 0.1% and 1% market depth indicators have tanked by at least 25% in the past 24 hours. (Kaiko) (Keiko)On Tuesday, Binance founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao stepped down as CEO and pleaded guilty as part of the U.S. settlement.

BNB changed hands at $234, recovering from the overnight low of $223, CoinDesk data show. Both currencies, however, were still down 3.3% and 11.5% on a 24-hour basis, nursing hangover from Tuesday's events, which saw Binance agree to a $4.3 billion settlement for violating sanctions and money-transmitting laws. Binance's founder CZ pleaded guilty and stepped down as CEO in what's called one of the largest corporate penalties ever, CoinDesk previously reported.Binance illegally relied on U.S. customers as a significant source of revenue and trading activity, recently unsealed documents show, with the criminal complaint revealing years of compliance failures and deliberate obfuscation to protect these crucial yet off-limits users. CZ's lawyers said that his sentencing will be delayed by 6 months and he has agreed to waive his right to appeal if the sentence does not exceed 18 months.Some traders believe CZ's downfall may be a blessing in disguise, boosting the probability of the U.S. SEC approving one or more spot bitcoin ETFs in the coming months.\"With this plea deal, the expectations for a spot Bitcoin ETF might have increased to 100% as the industry will be forced to follow the rules that TradFi firms must follow. More importantly, this industry's whitewashing will strengthen the Bitcoin adoption case for institutional players and will likely become a safe-haven asset in investors’ portfolios,\" crypto services provider Matrixport said in a Telegram message.Still, the price volatility spurred by the action against Binance and CZ looks to have proved costly for leverage traders. Data from Coinglass shows that in the 12 hours since the settlement was announced, $110 million in bitcoin long positions were liquidated compared to $37.2 million in short positions. In the last hour, that number has reversed with $4.26 million in short positions being liquidated compared to $111,000 in longs.BNB, which doesn't trade as actively as bitcoin because most users stake it, saw $3.73 million in long positions liquidated compared to $1.61 million in short positions, according to Coinglass. Data shows that options volume for BNB has surged by 68% to $2.41 million, while options open interest has surged 29% to $3.47 million.Elsewhere in the market, dYdX, the native token of the decentralized exchange, is up by 7%, according to CoinDesk Indicies data and Uniswap's UNI token is up by 1.6% on-day.Edited by Omkar Godbole."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesBinance Holding Ltd. would be asked to pay $4 billion to settle U.S. Department of Justice accusations of multiple criminal violations, according to a report from Bloomberg News on negotiations between the DOJ and the company, which also leave open the possibility its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao will face U.S. criminal charges. Binance has been under a lengthy investigation by U.S. authorities for money laundering, bank fraud and violating U.S. sanctions laws, and the talks could reportedly conclude in the coming weeks. A spokesperson with the DOJ declined to comment to CoinDesk. Binance didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Crypto exchange Kraken commingled customer and corporate funds while operating as an unregistered broker, clearing agency and dealer, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged in a new lawsuit Monday. The federal regulator claimed that the San Francisco-based company violated federal securities laws in a repeat of its suits against other crypto trading platforms. Unique to Monday's lawsuit are claims that Kraken created a \"significant risk\" by commingling up to $33 billion in customer crypto with its own corporate assets, the regulator said, quoting Kraken's independent auditor. \"Similarly, Kraken has held at times more than $5 billion worth of its customers' cash, and it also commingles some of its customers' cash with some of its own,\" the suit said. \"In fact, Kraken has at times paid operational expenses directly from bank accounts that hold customer cash.\"Many of the tokens mentioned in the Kraken lawsuit have actually posted double-digit gains year-to-date. Although many would think that being named by the SEC in enforcement actions time and time again would be a sort of scarlet letter for tokens and would lead to depressed prices, market data shows that's not the case. Perhaps a lesson to take away from this is that traders value technical capability over regulatory compliance – or they understand that the SEC is not the only regulator on the planet. According to on-chain data, many named tokens have outperformed bitcoin as part of a broader market rally. The \"basket\" of these tokens is up an average of 41%. Solana's SOL is up nearly 463% year-to-date. In June, when the SEC first accused SOL of being an unregistered security, the Solana Foundation quickly hit back to deny the accusations, and, as CoinDesk reported at the time, the developer community was largely indifferent.Chart of the DayThe chart shows the percentage of bitcoin's circulating supply in profit since 2011. The metric looks at the percentage of existing coins whose price at which they last moved on-chain was lower than the current market price of bitcoin.The seven-day moving average of percent supply in profit has jumped to 83.86%, the highest since December 2021.It's still short of the 95% threshold that marked previous bull market tops.Source: GlassnodeWe may earn a commission from partner links.

During the post-meeting press conference, Chairman Jerome Powell said the persistent strength in the labor market and consumer spending may warrant more liquidity tightening, a bearish prospect for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies.While the minutes due later today are likely to take a similar line, they may not elicit a reaction from financial markets. That's because weak U.S. economic data released since the meeting have bolstered expectations the central bank is done raising rates. In other words, the November meeting minutes may simply be outdated.Release of the minutes \"is likely to be less market-moving than usual, given the post-meeting softness in data,\" analysts at ING said in a Nov. 17 note to clients. \"We have already heard from several Fed officials who have welcomed the direction of the numbers but commented that they want to see more of the same to be sure that inflation is on the path to 2%.\"The Labor Department's employment report released Nov. 3 showed that job creation slowed to 150,000 jobs in October from 297,000 in September. The jobless rate rose to 3.9% while wage growth, measured by average hourly earnings, softened, signaling continued disinflation ahead. Data released last week showed the U.S. consumer price index grew a slower-than-expected 3.2% year-on-year in October, down from 3.7% in September.Since then, according to Fed funds futures, traders have brought forward expectations of interest-rate cuts to May. Bitcoin is known to closely follow changes in fiat liquidity conditions.Some observers, including Citi, agree the November meeting minutes are dated but say comments on the recent easing of financial conditions or availability of funding in the economy warrant attention. Tighter financial conditions affect households' and firms' saving and investment plans and weigh on economic growth and risk assets. Easy conditions have the opposite effect.The recent easing in financial conditions runs counter to the Fed's effort to contain inflation with tighter policy and may see the Fed add hawkish commentary to the minutes.\"Minutes from the November FOMC meeting may be most revealing regarding Fed officials' attitude toward financial conditions,\" Citi analysts wrote on Nov. 19. \"In October, Chair Powell and his colleagues argued that higher 10-year Treasury yields would substitute for further policy rate hikes. But as financial conditions have loosened, the response has been asymmetric, with little push-back against lower rates and higher equity prices.\"\"Minutes are compiled after the meeting, meaning officials might include some hawkish hints that conditions will need to remain tighter-for-longer to bring inflation lower,\" the analysts added, while noting the market reaction may be limited.Credit Agricole U.S. economist Nicholas Van Ness voiced a somewhat similar opinion.\"Given that financial conditions have eased somewhat following the meeting, this could mean some pushback from Fed speakers going forward against market pricing showing nearly 100bp of easing in 2024,\" he wrote in a Nov. 17 note.Bitcoin traded little changed around $37,300 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Some analysts are pointing to Avalanche's inclusion in the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) tokenization initiative, Project Guardian, earlier this week as a catalyst for the increase. The project includes the likes of Onyx by JPMorgan and Apollo Global. Meanwhile, NEAR likely drew strength from a series of developments announced last week at its annual Nearcon conference in Lisbon. Bitcoin lost ground on the week, dropping 3%, and ether fell 6%.BlackRock (BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its iShares Ethereum Trust, a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move follows last week's corporate registration of that name and Nasdaq's filing of a 19b-4 with the SEC seeking approval for the spot ETF. The price of ether (ETH) briefly jumped nearly 2% to $2,080 on the S-1 filing, but has since returned to roughly its price prior to the news.Crypto asset manager CoinShares said it secured an exclusive option to buy the exchange-traded fund (ETF) unit of Valkyrie Investments, gaining a U.S. foothold amid speculation the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF. The Saint Helier, Jersey-based company, whose shares trade on Nasdaq Stockholm, said the option expires March 31. CoinShares didn't disclose how much it paid for the option, or details of pricing for the acquisition, should it decide to go ahead. Spot crypto exchange-traded products are already available in Europe. That's not yet the case in the U.S., though speculation has swirled recently that one is coming – which could open up bitcoin investing to a broad range of people.Chart of the DayThe chart shows that the number of blockchain addresses holding at least $1,000 worth of BTC, known to move in tandem with BTC's price, surged to a record high of 8,306,118 on Nov. 15, topping the previous peak registered two years ago.Meanwhile, bitcoin's price is still 47% below the peak of $69,000 registered in November 2021.Source: GlassnodeWe may earn a commission from partner links.

        "content": "The global central bank tightening cycle that rocked financial markets, including bitcoin, last year seems to have peaked.U.S. financial conditions have eased despite the Fed's higher-for-longer interest-rate mantra.The U.S. 10-year Treasury note looks set to extend its recent slide in a positive development for risk assets.Bitcoin's (BTC) price has risen by 120% this year and most analysts foresee further gains in the near term. They point to expectations the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve one or more spot exchange-traded crypto funds (ETFs) soon and the halving of the Bitcoin blockchain's mining reward, which is due April next year.The bullish case is also gaining support from the wider economy. The charts below show a positive turnaround in the macroeconomic factors that played a role in last year's price crash.Global central bank policy cycleThe global tightening cycle that rocked financial assets, including cryptocurrencies, last year has peaked. (BIS, TS Lombard estimates) (BIS, TS Lombard estimates)The chart by TS Lombard shows the balance of central banks tightening versus those loosening since 1947. Positive values suggest a net bias for tighter monetary conditions, while negative values indicate a preference for easing.A loose policy involves boosting liquidity, that is releasing more money into the financial system, through interest-rate cuts and other measures and spurs risk-taking, as observed in 18 months following the coronavirus crash of March 2020. A tighter monetary policy involves sucking liquidity out with interest-rate increases and other tools to tame inflation. It often disincentivizes risk-taking in financial markets, as seen last year.The plot has recently turned lower, indicating that last year's global tightening cycle that rocked financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, has peaked, and there is now an increasing bias toward liquidity easing.With inflation rates slowing worldwide, central banks have room to take their feet off the tightening pedal. The move away from tightening could lead to an increased inflow of money into the crypto market. Bitcoin is known to be extremely sensitive to changes in global liquidity conditions and tends to rally when there's more money around.U.S. financial conditions easeThe chart below shows investment banking giant Goldman Sachs' U.S. Financial Conditions Index (FCI) since January.The index has tanked from the year's high of 100.74, seen only a few weeks ago, to just under 100, undoing all the tightening witnessed in September and October.The decline stands opposite the Federal Reserve's higher-for-longer interest-rate stance and hints at a resilient U.S. economy ahead, a positive development for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Most of bitcoin's year-to-date gains have occurred during the U.S. trading hours.The FCI has declined to just under 100, reversing the entire tightening from September and October. (Goldman Sachs) (Goldman Sachs)The FCI is a weighted average of short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, the trade-weighted U.S. dollar exchange rate, an index of credit spreads, and the ratio of equity prices to the 10-year average of earnings per share.A 1% fall (rise) in the index is known to bring about a 1% positive (negative) GDP impulse in the subsequent three to four quarters.According to Fed analysts, financial conditions are a “constellation of asset prices and interest rates” that change based on economic health and monetary policy, and which can also potentially affect the economy itself.Breakdown in the 10-year Treasury yieldAnother positive development for bitcoin is the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which has declined by 50 basis points to 4.43% since the Treasury announced a slower pace of bond purchases at the beginning of the month. A decline in the 10-year yield, the so-called risk-free rate, often forces investors to seek higher returns through other assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.The 10-year yield could drop further, as the daily chart shows a bearish head-and-shoulders technical analysis pattern.\"10-year yields delivered a lower high (as expected) and broke lower, clearing a head and shoulders top. The pattern yields a target of about 3.93%, but current levels (uptrend) and 4.33% (breakout point) are potential supports too,\" EFG Bank's research team said in a note to clients this week.U.S. 10-year Treasury yield's daily chart (TradingView/CoinDesk)Potential risksThe reversal of tighter financial conditions signaled by Goldman's FCI index could introduce a more hawkish tone into Fed comments, forcing markets to reconsider the possibility of another rate hike in the coming months. That might slow down the pace of bitcoin's rally.Bulls should also keep an eye on Japan's exit from ultra-easy monetary policy, geopolitical issues, U.S. commercial property concerns, and potential flare-up in inflation as sources of price volatility in risk assets.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

When bitcoin approached $38,000, the sell orders took over, sending the price lower. That, in turn, triggered liquidations of leveraged long positions, sending the price hurtling further downward.Indeed, the crypto market's two-day rollercoaster hit derivatives traders heavily, liquidating some $340 million of leveraged positions over the period, CoinGlass data shows.Total crypto liquidations per day (CoinGlass)SOL, LINK give up gains; AVAX extends rallyMost cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin lower during the day, with ether (ETH) dropping 4% over the past 24 hours to $1,960. Solana's (SOL) and Chainlink's native token (LINK) declined 6% and 9%, respectively.Fading the plunge today was Avalanche's native token (AVAX), extending yesterday's double-digit rally with another 7% gain.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks the performance of a basket of almost 200 cryptocurrencies, dropped 4% during the day.Spot bitcoin ETF delay slows momentumThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Wednesday delayed a decision about HashDex's spot BTC ETF application, increasing the odds that it won't approve any such vehicles this year.Crypto market analytics firm K33 Research noted earlier this week in a report said that a lack of an SEC decision this week could halt momentum in the crypto market until the next deadline early in 2024.Heightened optimism about spot ETFs and what are hoped to be sizable institutional and retail inflows helped propel bitcoin from $25,000 in September to just shy of $38,000. There still could be news this week as Franklin Templeton has a decision deadline of tomorrow. Few, though, are expecting anything except another delay from the SEC.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is delaying a decision on an application by Hashdex to convert its existing bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) into a spot vehicle. The agency also delayed action on Grayscale's attempt to launch a new futures-based ether ETF. Hashdex filed to convert its bitcoin futures ETF into a spot bitcoin ETF in September. Grayscale (a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group) filed for its ether futures ETF that same month. Both filings faced initial deadlines of Nov. 17 for a decision, but the SEC said it was extending this window, according to a pair of Wednesday filings.The Philippines government said it plans to raise 10 billion pesos ($180 million) through the sale of a tokenized treasury bond next week, in the latest move by a government to embrace blockchain technology to digitize its domestic debt market. The planned sale follows an offering from Hong Kong, which issued an 800 million-Hong Kong dollar ($103 million) tokenized green bond in February. The Philippines Bureau of the Treasury intends to confirm the interest rate of the one-year bond on Nov. 20, with the issue and settlement date set for Nov. 22. It reserved the right to change the mechanics of the issue.Bitcoin’s (BTC) bullish momentum will likely remain intact heading into the end of the year, lifting prices to the $40,000 mark, according to Markus Thielen, research head at crypto services provider Matrixport and founder of analytics portal DeFi Research. “Bitcoin will reach $40,000 – if not even $45,000 – by the year’s end,” Thielen said in a note shared with CoinDesk, citing options market positioning and dovish Federal Reserve expectations as catalysts for continued price gains.

The cryptocurrency has more than doubled this year, with prices rising nearly 40% in the past four weeks alone.The recent bullish action spurred demand for call options or derivatives, giving the purchaser the right to snap up the underlying asset at a predetermined price later.Per Thielen, the increased demand for the so-called bullish bets has left some market participants, mainly market makers, who are always on the opposite side of clients’ trades, exposed to continued upside in cryptocurrency. These entities will likely buy BTC and hedge themselves as prices rise, adding to bullish pressures around the cryptocurrency.“We have two colossal options expiries on Nov. 24 and Dec. 29 with $3.7bn and $5.4 billion open interest outstanding. There are 85% more calls outstanding than puts, with the 40,000 strikes having the most significant open interest. The closer we get to $40,000, the more people will have to buy bitcoin to hedge themselves,” Thielen noted.“There will be a broad interest in pushing prices to this $40,000 level. The odds are high that we reach this level,” Thielen added. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $37,445.Another factor supporting the bullish case is the receding U.S. inflation rate and hopes for rate cuts or liquidity easing by the Fed.The Fed rates by 525 basis points in 14 months to May 2023 to tame rampant inflation. The Fed’s rapid liquidity tightening disincentivized investing in risky assets and was partly responsible for last year’s crypto crash.The inflation rate, however, has markedly slowed in recent months, having reached as high as 9.1% in June last year. Data released Tuesday showed the U.S. CPI climbed 3.2% in the 12 months through October, following September’s 3.7% rise.Per UBS, slowing inflation means the Fed could halve the benchmark interest rate to 2.75% from the present range of 5.25% to 5.5%. Per the Fed funds futures, markets have priced in 90 basis points of rate cuts by the end of 2024.“The U.S. inflation [headline CPI] is currently at 3.2% while interest rates are at 5.25% – a difference of 2.0%. If our inflation model is current, then this spread would even be 3.0% – so we could expect 200 basis points of rate cuts next year. This is bullish,” Thielen said.Thielen expects inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), to drop below the Fed’s 2% target in 2024.Lastly, the spot ETF optimism could continue to support price gains. According to Bloomberg’s analysts, there is a 90% chance the SEC will approve one or more spot ETFs before Jan. 10.Read: Crypto Market Sees Net Capital Inflow for First Time in 17 MonthsEdited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "U.S. regulators don't have any more authority now to head off another major crypto collapse than they did when FTX imploded and took much of the industry with it, said Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam.\"Nothing has changed, and we could be in a position where another FTX-type event happens,\" Behnam said Wednesday at the Financial Markets Quality Conference 2023 at Georgetown University. However, he noted that the crypto investing enthusiasm has calmed since the months before FTX, and \"the market environment is much, much different today than it was a year ago.\"He noted – as he routinely does – that the CFTC has limited powers over the markets in which assets such as bitcoin trade directly. In that spot market, his agency only has the authority to intervene when market-manipulation and fraudulent activity is pointed out to the regulators. CFTC officials don't have the reach they do in the crypto derivatives sector, where they can assess companies' registrations and supervise their behaviors directly. And the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) only polices the securities markets.While SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly said he believes the bulk of crypto tokens are securities, there are some cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, that don't fall under that regulator's jurisdiction. Behnam also puts ether on that list, noting Wednesday that the non-security crypto tokens make up \"easily 50% – if not more – of the marketplace.\"LegislationSince FTX, U.S. lawmakers have pursued legislation to give the CFTC jurisdiction over direct, cash markets, but those crypto market-structure bills still await action. One of them was approved by committees in the House of Representatives and would need a vote from the overall chamber, but the Republican-led effort so far lacks support in the Democrat-controlled Senate.\"There's obviously a lot going on in Congress these days,\" Behnam said. \"These bills have been caught, I think a little bit in a holding pattern.\"Crypto lobbyists had hoped that crypto bills – also including one that would set up U.S. guardrails for stablecoin issuers – would get a House floor vote before the end of the year. But Congress has largely been occupied with keeping the federal government open as lawmakers hash out spending bills, and the House was recently sidetracked after Republicans ousted former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and replaced him with Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.).Prediction marketsThe CFTC chief also addressed his agency's court fight with prediction market Kalshi over political-outcomes betting. His agency has opposed Kalshi's election contracts and was taken to court over that decision, depending in part on deciding whether there's societal value in hedging political risk by being able to engage in contracts that pay if – for instance – a certain person or party is elected.\"If there are allegations of fraud or manipulation in an election – whether it's a local district in Iowa, or any other state – you can imagine we then become an election cop,\" said Behnam. \"If there's a listed futures or unlisted derivative on an election and there's an allegation of fraud in that election, that fraud would presumably have affected the price revaluation of the listed future.\"He said he doesn't want the CFTC to have to assume that role in U.S. elections.Read More: Crypto's Bromance With U.S. CFTC May Be One-SidedEdited by Nikhilesh De."

        "content": "In November 2022, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced a country-level dollar cost averaging (DCA) plan, promising to buy one bitcoin every day.At the time, the country – based on public statements from Bukele - was already the owner of 2,381 bitcoins purchased at an average price of roughly $44,300. The price then was just $19,000, putting the country at about a $60 million loss on its holdings.Bukele has kept pretty quiet about El Salvador’s purchases since and the exact amount of bitcoin that the country owns is not clear as there is no public government record.Assuming that the country did indeed purchase one bitcoin per day over the past year, CoinDesk estimates El Salvador's holdings would sum to 2,744 bitcoin as of Nov. 14. Based on the median price of BTC over each of those days, the country's average purchase price would have drifted down to roughly $41,800.Figuring a current bitcoin price of $36,000, El Salvador would now be sitting on a loss of about $16 million on its bitcoin holdings.Since Bukele moved to make bitcoin legal tender, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly warned of increased risks to the country's economic growth and ability to make good on its debt. Despite the modest paper losses on the nation's bitcoin holdings, things to this point appear to be on a good path.El Salvador's bonds in mid-August had posted a 70% year-to-date return, with a number of big-name banks recommending that more gains were coming. The country's debt earlier this month was upgraded at S&P Global to B- from CCC+. Bukele recently announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024 and polls show him with an overwhelming lead.As to whether the populace is rushing to adopt a bitcoin standard, questions remain. One place to check would be remittances from outside the country, given the economy's reliance on those payments. According to central bank data, of $7 billion in remittances from abroad in 2022, just 1.2% used cryptocurrency wallets.CoinDesk reached out to the President’s team who did not respond to comment.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesSingapore's central bank is starting to test tokenization use cases alongside major traditional finance players including JPMorgan, DBS, and BNY Mellon. The tests will examine bilateral digital asset trades, foreign currency payments, multicurrency clearing and settlement, fund management and automated portfolio rebalancing, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said Wednesday. JPMorgan and Apollo have carried out a \"proof of concept\" to demonstrate how asset managers could tokenize funds on the blockchain as part of the project, the firms announced concurrently with MAS' statement. The initiative is part of Project Guardian, a policymaker group that includes Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), the U.K's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to advance asset tokenization.OKX, the second-largest cryptocurrency trading platform, is providing derivatives trading without the counterparty risk associated with assets being held on the exchange, enriching an existing arrangement with asset manager CoinShares and custody joint venture Komainu. Since FTX blew up last year, a number of players in the crypto space have devised ways to trade and settle off-exchange from the safe confines of a trusted custody setup. Off-exchange settlement is relatively easily done for spot markets, said Lewis Fellas, the head of hedge-fund solutions at CoinShares. A big differentiator, he said, is providing a similar arrangement when it comes to derivatives trading.SC Ventures, the fintech investment and venture arm of banking group Standard Chartered, announced new tokenization platform on Tuesday. Libeara will enable the creation of a tokenized Singapore dollar government bond fund for accredited investors, according to the announcement. The platform has also partnered with FundBridge Capital, an organization for fund managers in Singapore. By working with Libeara \"we are ensuring that we can provide additional investment opportunities enabled by lower operating costs, higher transparency and higher operational efficiency,” Sue Lynn Lim, CEO and COO of FundBridge Capital said in a statement.Chart of the DayThe chart shows number of bitcoin held in wallets associated with miners or those responsible for minting coins.The balance has declined by 4,775 BTC since Oct. 23, a sign of miners running down their inventory in a rising market.Source: Glassnode- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsCentral Bank Digital Currencies Can Replace Cash, Offer Resilience: IMF ChiefDYDX Pumps Ahead of Massive $500M Token UnlockJPMorgan, Apollo Tokenize Funds in 'Proof of Concept' With Axelar, Oasis, ProvenanceEdited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "The bitcoin options market is now bigger than the BTC futures market in terms of notional open interest.The flipping is a sign of market maturity and the influx of sophisticated traders in the market.The crypto market has come back to life this year, with bitcoin (BTC) doubling in value, supposedly on the back of haven demand, spot ETF excitement in the U.S. and dovish Federal Reserve expectations.While most activity was initially concentrated in bitcoin's spot and futures markets, options tied to the cryptocurrency, which offer a cheap way to bet on a price rise or drop, have become more prominent.In terms of open interest (OI), the BTC options market is now bigger than the futures market. At press time, the U.S. dollar value locked in active options contracts stood at $17.39 billion, almost 10% more than futures' open interest of $15.84 billion, according to data source CoinGlass.Increased activity in the options market is a sign of market sophistication, according to Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of leading crypto options exchange Deribit.\"The surpassing of BTC options open interest over futures OI is a clear sign of the market maturing,\" Strijers told CoinDesk. \"This shift indicates a growing preference for options as tools for strategic positioning, hedging, or access to the recent rise of implied volatility, reflecting the market's evolving sophistication.\"A bigger options market also means traders need to consider the impact of quarterly and monthly settlements and market makers' hedging activities on spot prices.Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put confers the right to sell.Traditionally, options are used to mitigate risk, although some speculators use them like futures to amplify returns. Bulls typically buy puts to protect against a potential downside, while bears use call options to protect from a sudden upswing in prices. Efficient use of options is contingent on a thorough understanding of key metrics, the so-called Greeks – delta, gamma, theta and rho, that affect the price of an options contract.One possible reason for options' growing popularity is that they allow traders to not only hedge against and profit from the bitcoin price, but also other factors such as volatility or the degree of price turbulence and time.Writing or selling options to profit from a market lull and collect an additional yield on top of the spot market holdings were popular strategies earlier this year. More recently, traders have bought options to benefit from the renewed volatility explosion. Volatility has a positive impact on options' prices.Unlike options, spot and futures markets are one-dimensional, allowing speculation only on the direction of the price.Futures contracts commit a buyer to pay for and a seller to deliver a particular asset at a future date. Futures are generally considered more risky than options, involving greater leverage and allowing traders to control assets of much greater value. That exposes futures traders to outsized losses that exceed the value of their initial deposit and to forced liquidations by exchanges.UPDATE (Nov. 15, 09:24 UTC): Adds interpretation to headline.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "Funding rates on the futures of major tokens have started to revert to normal levels after recent euphoria led to traders paying unusually high fees to remain in their long positions.Large movements in spot markets led to open interest surging to over $35 billion over the weekend, indicating highly leveraged bets from traders hoping for even higher prices. This was a near 40% increase since the $24 billion level at the end of October, data shows.The levered pile-on meant funding levels moved to some of their highest in recent months. Funding rates are periodic payments made by traders based on the difference between prices in the futures and spot markets.Data shows traders were paying anywhere from 0.2% to 0.5% in fees every eight hours on their borrowed funds to remain in their long positions. This meant speculators paid as much as 50 cents to exchanges on a $100 position.Futures funding rates were at unusually high levels in the past week. (Coinglass)However, some market watchers warned of a dump as traders were more incentivized to go short or bet against, a price rise as such positions earned fees from those going long. In futures trading, longs pay shorts when funding is positive, and vice-versa when funding is negative.This likely culminated in Tuesday’s market drop as traders took profits on a week-long rise.Nearly 90% of bullish bets were liquidated, amounting to over $300 million, with bitcoin traders losing $120 million as prices sank 4%. Ether traders lost $63 million, while XRP and Solana’s SOL-tracked futures saw over $30 million in cumulative liquidations.Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move. As such, funding rates are back to normal levels of an average of 0.01% on most exchanges as of Wednesday morning.Crypto markets added over 6% in the past week on the back of heightened expectations of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S., with some analysts reiterating a 90% chance of a January nod.Elsewhere, traditional finance giant BlackRock filed for an ether (ETH) ETF – buoying the token higher, alongside alternatives such as Avalanche, Solana and Polygon.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

This was the largest amount of liquidated longs in a day since August 17, when bitcoin (BTC) plunged from above $28,000 to about $25,000 in the space of a few minutes.Today's wipeout happened as BTC tumbled 4% to $35,000 despite a generally supportive environment for risk assets following a cooler-than-expected October inflation reading that sent stocks sharply higher and bond yields substantially lower. The decline was broad-based across crypto, including ether's (ETH) 6% fall to below $2,000.Read more: Bitcoin Drops 4% to $35K Despite Soaring Tradfi Markets, But Analysts Remain OptimisticToday's action stands in contrast to that of the past few weeks which have been notable for \"short squeezes\" as rising asset prices forced liquidations of money-losing leveraged bets on lower prices.Liquidations happen when an exchange is forced to close a leveraged trading position due to the partial or total loss of the trader's margin, or money down. Cascading liquidations can exacerbate price volatility as traders cover their positions, flushing out excess leverage on the market.The large amount of liquidations suggests that the sudden decline in prices caught most investors off-guard, with 88,667 traders getting flushed, CoinGlass shows. Bitcoin traders suffered the most liquidations at $133 million, followed by ETH traders with some $70 million.JPMorgan analysts said in a report last week that the recent rally in cryptocurrency prices was getting \"overdone,\" as investors became overly optimistic about the spot BTC exchange-traded fund approval's impact on asset prices.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

At press time, bitcoin was recently changing hands at $35,300, down 3.7% over the past 24 hours.Ether (ETH) tumbled almost 6% over the same time frame, losing the $2,000 level it previously regained last week for the first time since July on BlackRock's spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing.Large-cap altcoins such as dogecoin (DOGE), Polygon's (MATIC) and Tron's [TRON] native tokens endured 6%-7% declines over the day.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad basket of almost 200 cryptos, declined 4.5%, underscoring the market-wide losses.Is the bitcoin price rally over?Traditional markets, meanwhile, were all in on the idea that the Federal Reserve is now finished with rate hikes and indeed could be cutting rates in the first half of 2024. Late in the session Tuesday, the Nasdaq was higher by 2.3% (and now ahead more than 10% in November) and the S&P 500 was up 1.8%.The action in bond markets was even more dramatic, with the 10-year Treasury yield plunging 20 basis points to 4.44%.

Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, listed Ordinals' token ORDI earlier this week and it almost doubled in price before giving up some of its gains Wednesday.\"While ordinals have been limited to memecoin implementations, they do act as a proxy for increasing demand for Bitcoin blockspace,\" 21Shares analysts said.Read more: The Ordinals Protocol Has Caused a Resurgence in Bitcoin DevelopmentThe resurgence of Ordinals also helps the bottom line of bitcoin miners, the report pointed out, with blockchain transaction fees now making up about 8.5% of their revenue.This is of particular import for the miners as Bitcoin's quadrennial halving event expected in April 2024 is drawing nearer, which will cut block rewards for the industry in half.UPDATE (Nov. 8, 19:40 UTC): Adds detail about Bitcoin and Ethereum NFT sales volume data by CryptoSlam.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Users are required to use the Binance app to create a wallet, with the app serving as the venue for activities such as staking, lending and borrowing. The wallet will also use multiparty computation (MPC), which involves a private key being broken into three parts of which the wallet owner controls two, as a means of removing the need to memorize seed phrases. The new wallet appears to compete with TrustWallet, which the exchange bought in 2018. TrustWallet's native token (TWT) fell following Binance's announcement. TWT had experienced a positive week prior to this, thanks in part to Binance listing TWT futures on its exchange, which saw volume increase from around $80 million to $476 million on Monday.HSBC said it plans to start a custody service of tokenized securities for institutional clients alongside Swiss crypto custodian Metaco. The service is set to go live in 2024 and will complement HSBC's existing platform for digital asset issuance and its recent tokenized physical gold offering, the bank said. HSBC pointed out that the service will not pertain to cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Tokenization, the process of issuing and trading real-world assets on blockchains, is one of the most prominent ways in which major financial institutions are becoming involved in the digital asset industry. Boston Consulting Group estimated last year that tokenization could become a $16 trillion industry by 2030.Grayscale's investment product linked to Chainlink's LINK token is trading at a 200% premium to spot prices, which suggests institutional demand. The Grayscale Chainlink Trust (GLNK) closed at $39 on Monday compared with $21 on Oct. 31. Each GLNK share holds just $12 worth of LINK, making it nearly three times pricier than the actual value of held assets. The product has historically traded at a premium of over 20%. While premiums have reached as much as 150% on two separate occasions since the product's launch in May last year, Monday's is its highest ever.

The company created the data set by using the list of tokens added each quarter to the tracking website CoinMarketCap, and then stripping out so-called memecoins that serve no ostensible purpose but to provide yuks and a vessel for speculation.Some 293 new tokens were added in the third quarter, down from 366 in the second quarter and 449 in the year-earlier period, according to the data. During the height of the bull market in cryptocurrencies in the fourth quarter of 2021, some 1,261 new tokens were created.The numbers are consistent with separate reports illustrating the depths of so-called crypto winter. A report last month from the digital-asset firm Galaxy noted that venture-capital funding for crypto and blockchain projects slid last quarter to the lowest since late 2020.\"It may still be a sign of crypto winter where everyone has paused developing and launching, waiting for the arrival of spring,\" said Ronghui Gu, CertiK's co-founder, who is also an assistant professor of computer science at Columbia University in New York.Decline in liquiditySeveral blockchain projects have had to cut staff, with NFT marketplace OpenSea being the latest to do so, announcinga 50% reduction on Nov. 3, with the CEO writing in a post on X that the company was \"building a new foundation.\"\"It's probably partially due the general decline in liquidity in the industry,\" said Sean Farrell, a crypto analyst at the independent investment-research firm FundStrat. \"No one wants to list a token when there there is a lack of risk-taking.\"But the price of bitcoin staged a powerful rally in October, and major altcoins have also been on the rise, fueling speculation that the worst of the market malaise might be over.Last week, funds for investing in cryptocurrencies attracted some $767 million of fresh money, marking the best six-week stretch since the 2021 bull market.The recent drop in token listings may reflect, to some degree, a maturation of the crypto industry, FundStrat's Farrell said.\"There are more legitimate projects out there now, so the battle for that incremental liquidity is tougher,\" he said. \"The bar for launching a token is higher.\"Some would-be issuers may have been deterred by the risk of running afoul of regulators – a heedfulness that may not have existed in prior eras of the 14-year-old crypto industry.\"The regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. has discouraged many projects from launching tokens,\" Farrell said.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies appear to have staying power, Federal Reserve’s Chairman Jerome Powell said in June. Perhaps truer words have never been spoken, as the market value of all cryptocurrencies has doubled to $1.3 trillion this year, recovering from last year’s crash.More impressive is the renewed interest in centralized crypto-collateralized finance after last year’s controversial collapse of industry giants BlockFi, Celsius, and others.“Since the soft launch of our lending offering on Sept. 13, we’ve been surprised by how much demand there is for crypto-secured loans,” Alexander Blume, managing partner at SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, told CoinDesk.“We have seen about $2 billion in demand for bitcoin-secured loans since we started offering them in September,” Blume said.Crypto-collateralized lending is an arrangement where a borrower pledges bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or other digital assets as security and primarily draws the loan in the form of fiat currencies. In case a debt goes bad, the lender usually, as the contractual authority, liquidates the pledged crypto asset to recover the amount loaned.The loans are typically overcollateralized, meaning the value of the collateral is far greater than the loan’s value. It ensures the lender has some cushion to protect against losses from a potential decline in the value of the collateral asset.Crypto-backed fiat loans are preferred during bullish market trends as rising prices boost the value of the collateral while the borrower deploys the fiat loan to purchase other cryptocurrencies or buy mining equipment, usually denominated in U.S. dollars.The arrangement allows miners or investors to keep their crypto holdings while sourcing additional fiat money to fund operations and yield-generating strategies.CeFi platforms like BlockFi, Celsius and Voyager saw tremendous growth during the 2020-21 bull runs before last year's crypto market crash exposed the lack of proper risk prevention measures at these lending giants. At its peak, Celsius had over $20 billion worth of assets under management and more than 1.7 million users.The three firms declared bankruptcy last year, freezing depositors’ accounts and their ability to withdraw their money. The episode drew the ire of U.S. regulators.\"After the fall of Genesis, BlockFi, Celsius, and others, a major gap in the market emerged for responsibly managed secured loans for institutions. Two Prime is well-positioned to fill it,\" Blume said, adding that we are focused on institutional borrowers.About 85% of the fiat loans extended by Two Prime so far are collateralized by bitcoin, while the rest are secured by ether and other larger alternative cryptocurrencies.Interest rates vary based on loan-to-value ratio, duration and size, but generally range from 5% to 12%, Blume said.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

At press time, bitcoin was trading at $35,600, up nearly 2% over the past 24 hours.Solana (SOL), toncoin (TON) and Crypto.com's Cronos ecosystem token (CRO) gained 5%-10% during the same period, helped by continued capital rotation into altcoins. Binance's BNB, Ripple's XRP, Cardano's ADA and dogecoin (DOGE) gave back some gains from earlier this week, retreating 3%-4%.Ether (ETH) remained flat at around $1,900 Wednesday, but one analyst suggested not going to sleep on the world's 2nd-largest crypto, noting increased blockchain activity could push its price to $3,000.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a basket of 189 cryptocurrencies, was up 1%.With the crypto rally now fully expanded past just bitcoin, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization topped $1.31 trillion Tuesday, TradingView data shows. That's the highest reading since late May 2022, marked by the implosion of the Terra ecosystem.Total cryptocurrency market capitalization (TradingView)Increasing risk-on sentiment on traditional markets also supported the digital asset space. Safe haven asset gold sank to its lowest price in three weeks, while West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) plummeted 4% to its weakest level since July. The Nasdaq 100 advanced 1.1%, now on a seven-day winning streak.What's next for bitcoin (BTC)?As bitcoin's price stays increasingly compressed in the range between $34,000 and $36,000, capital rotation into altcoins is creating a \"mini altcoin season,\" a K33 Research report noted.It's a typical behavior on the crypto market that traders take profits after a sizable BTC rally and put the proceedings in smaller, riskier tokens.At the same time, K33 pointed out, accelerating inflows into bitcoin-related funds provides support for BTC's price.\"It’s hard, nearly impossible, not to remain bullish,\" K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde said. \"An ETF verdict is nine weeks away, and institutional traders provide the only significant heater witnessed in the derivatives market.\"\"November represents yet another solid month for aggressive accumulation of bitcoin, with an extended plan to distribute, reduce exposure, and reallocate to altcoins once the cat’s out of the bag,\" Lunde added.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

Following the news, the ETH price surged to the highest level of the day (Thursday), nearing $2,100 and up about 3% compared with just before the filing came out. It later gave back about half that gain, though it remains about 9% higher than 24 hours before. The company's plan was revealed in a filing by Nasdaq, the U.S. exchange where BlackRock will seek to list the product, which will need regulatory approval. Earlier on Thursday, it emerged that the corporate entity \"iShares Ethereum Trust\" had been registered in the state of Delaware; iShares is the name of BlackRock's ETF division.Ether's (ETH) BlackRock (BLK)-prompted surge past $2,000 on Thursday stole the spotlight from bitcoin (BTC), which is down slightly on the day, at around $36,500, while ether is now around $2,100. According to David Lo, head of financial products at Bybit, ether could push further. “Historically, ETH often makes significant gains following a peak in Bitcoin's value, a pattern that may repeat here giving us a price target of around $2500,” said Lo. “After that, there may be a final rotation of profits into lower-cap coins before a cooling-off period, which may involve an overall 10-30% correction.”Swiss bank UBS' wealthy clients can now take on exposure to three crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through the lender's Hong Kong platform, according to a Bloomberg report citing a person familiar with the matter. The ETFs, Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active, CSOP Bitcoin Futures and CSOP Ether Futures ETFs, are all authorized by Hong Kong's securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).

The rally came on reports that BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, wants to create an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that purchases ETH and saw the ether-bitcoin ratio rise by 9% from 17-month lows.Activity in the options market suggests ether's outperformance is more than a one-off event and could continue over the near term.The spread between Deribit's forward-looking 30-day implied volatility indices for ether (ETH DVOL) and bitcoin (BTC DVOL) has turned positive in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of 5.9%, the highest since April, according to Amberdata. Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period.The positive turnaround indicates traders expect more action in ether over the next four weeks.

(Amberdata). (Amberdata)\"The rotation out of BTC into ETH (during alt season was attractive), and so the market chased it and caught people short options, so [ETH IV] ripped higher,\" Anderson added. As such, people look to be chasing ether now that it shows signs of life.Bitcoin has surged over 35% since early October, mainly on expectations that a potential spot ETF could bring a $100 billion or more in inflows over five years.Similar inflows could have a bigger impact on ether, whose market capitalization of $252.41 billion is just 1/3 of bitcoin's $713.10 billion.\"ETH has a relatively minor market cap than BTC, which means that when the same size of liquidity flows into ETH, the price of ETH will be pushed higher, and the volatility will be greater,\" Griffin Ardnern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Binance was at $3.8 billion.CME is a stalwart of traditional finance, a Chicago-based firm whose business covers a wide span of financial, commodity and agricultural futures and options. The timing of it overtaking Binance, a crypto-focused exchange, is poignant. Wall Street firms like BlackRock are increasingly steering the narrative around bitcoin and the rest of crypto, by trying, for instance, to introduce bitcoin and ether (ETH) ETFs in an attempt to open up crypto investing to a broader group of people. Such financial heavyweights are accustomed to doing business on a highly regulated exchange like CME, as opposed to Binance, which has run into trouble with U.S. regulators.\"As market participants seek regulated venues and highly liquid products to hedge market volatility and manage price exposure, we continue to see increased institutional interest across our crypto suite,\" said Tim McCourt, global head of financial and OTC products at CME Group. \"Market participants view CME Group as a valued source for risk management.\"The change in rankings occurred as the crypto market endured a major leverage flush-out amid wild price swings on Thursday. The aggregate bitcoin open interest dropped by $2 billion from $12 billion. The decline impacted Binance traders disproportionately more than CME market participants.Cumulative market share gains and losses by exchanges in 2023 (FalconX)Bitcoin first surged to an 18-month high of almost $38,000 on Thursday, then sharply retraced toward $36,000 after a filing showed a corporate entity named \"iShares Ethereum Trust\" had been registered in the state of Delaware.

A paper published by Bitwise Asset Management in 2020 said that the CME bitcoin futures market leads the spot market in a consistent and statistically significant manner.\"The CME has been gaining market share for almost all of 2023, but these gains intensified over the past few weeks as market excitement around the BTC spot ETF applications soared,\" David Lawant, head of research at trading platform FalconX, told CoinDesk in a note.\"Given the CME is a venue used almost exclusively by large traditional financial institutions, it shows how much interest there has been from this audience in crypto,\" Lawant added.Binance didn't respond to a request for comment, though CEO Changpeng Zhao posted a screenshot of this article on X (formerly Twitter) and wrote: \"U.S. institutions are moving into crypto.

On this day two years ago, Nov. 9, 2021, bitcoin maxis were sporting red laser eyes, FTX had just closed a $420 million funding round and rumor had it that dogecoin’s (DOGE) biggest fan, Elon Musk, may host an upcoming episode of “S and L.” On this day, just two short years ago, bitcoin (BTC) set its highest price ever.This post is part of Consensus Magazine’s Trading Week, sponsored by CME. This is column first published in The Node newsletter.UnmuteBitcoin’s “all-time high” is a matter of debate. Depending on where you look, the high water mark will be different. Coinbase calls the top at $68,569 (Nov. 8, 2021 at 7:00 p.m.), CoinMarketCap says it’s $66,953 and your most trusted and trustworthy news and data provider, CoinDesk, notches it a little above $67,000.I, like many, tend to call the pico top at $69,000 – because it’s okay to round up to the meme number, and because consensus in such a fragmented and illiquid market is really a subjective matter (involving where to draw the line about which exchanges to follow and data sources to watch.)See also: Bitcoin Tops $37KThe price itself, in retrospect, hardly matters. What was important at the time was that bitcoin was trading up. It was rallying, on an upswing fostered by a collective belief. Many truly thought that bitcoin wouldn’t stop, that $100,000 was soon on the way if we all just believed hard enough. Hence the laser eyes.It’s now commonly understood that this most historic of rallies was fueled by COVID-era stimulus, boredom and historically low interest rates. That crypto could be impacted by macroeconomic fluctuations was a bitter pill to swallow. Thought to be an inflation hedge, BTC instead traded like many other assets on the far-end of the risk curve.The months leading up to November 2021’s ATH were a period of “irrational exuberance,” to steal a phrase from Nobel laureate Robert Shiller. Heads of state at the time were seriously concerned about the risks crypto posed to the wider financial system. Jon Cunliffe, then (like now) Bank of England’s deputy governor, likened the multi-trillion dollar crypto market to the subprime mortgage industry in 2008.There were few actual use cases for crypto, yet a ton of leverage in the system. Crypto, for better or worse, is primarily a market built for speculators. The chief innovations that have come from over a decade of technical research, billions in venture financing and tens of thousands of startups have been financial products like “perpetual swaps” and novel indexes (not to discount pioneering ZK tech).Cunliffe was correctly worried about the credit risks that had built up in crypto. It’s telling that the first wave of bankruptcies after the market crashed were the centralized lending firms like Celsius and BlockFi. And that FTX’s chief undoing was stacking billions in loans on illiquid collateral. But he was wrong about the potential knock on effects of crypto cratering.Although pension funds, hedge funds and millions of Americans were invested in crypto, the market itself remained insular.Today, crypto appears to have decoupled somewhat from the wider economy. While bitcoin hit its all-time high during the same period that the benchmark equity index S&P 500 was cresting on a decade-long bull run, it started trading up at a time when some said “Tech was in a Recession.” Bitcoin is up well over 100% year-to-date, and altcoins are rallying right alongside it.Much of the excitement about bitcoin is being driven by the “narrative” of growing institutional interest. This isn’t entirely a false story: a number of significant Wall St. firms like BlackRock, VanEck and Fidelity are poised to launch crypto-based exchange-traded funds. Banks are building on blockchains, and “tokenization” has become a finance bro buzzword.Few people are still talking about crypto’s “banking problems,” and the industry successfully collaborated to dispel a dangerous political movement trying to link Hamas funding to crypto. Ask any white-collar commuter in Grand Central what they think about crypto and it’ll likely be “well, it’s not going away.”See also: How Policy Shaped Crypto's Banking Prospects | OpinionIt likely remains the case that in the long term, crypto prices are still driven by macroeconomic forces. Bitcoin hit a low and traded sideways while Fed Chair Jerome Powell was raising rates, and it’s still an open question how the asset, launched as a reaction the greed and macroeconomic policies that kickstarted Great Financial Crisis, will fare in an official recession, which could come next year.In other words, despite signs of a thaw, crypto winter may not be over. There’s hope that the months-long deep freeze drove out the riff-raff, while the brightest minds continued to build. And while a “killer app” hasn’t been found, it’s clear enough the industry has a committed user base. But along with the  institutional capital, supposedly waiting on the sidelines to be deployed after a BTC ETF goes live, are likely another wave of speculators and scammers.I don’t know if crypto’s increasing institutionalization will finally prove Cunliffe right about the risks crypto poses to the wider economy. If prices continue to rip without an actual cause, like an actual use case, it can only be explained by speculation — another round of the “greater fool” fearing FOMO.But I can say if bitcoin hits $100,000 because of an ETF, it might cost its soul."

        "content": "Thursday's huge price swings in the two largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum's ether (ETH), prompted more than $400 million of open trades to get liquidated, the most since the August crash.The wild session comes at a time when BTC and ETH prices have been surging amid Wall Street's burgeoning interest in crypto. Both cryptos surpassed round-number milestones they haven't seen recently. BTC topped $36,000 and then $37,000 for the first time since May 2022 – and almost reached $38,000 – before retracing much of the rally. ETH got above $2,000 and hit the highest level since the April Ethereum upgrade known as Shanghai.Optimism over ETFs and the potential gusher of money they could lure into the industry fueled the move higher. On Wednesday, CoinDesk reported that Grayscale is in talks with two key Securities and Exchange Commission departments about the conversion of its bitcoin trust, known as GBTC, into an ETF.And then on Thursday, it appeared that BlackRock registered a new corporate entity – called the \"iShares Ethereum Trust\" – in the U.S. state of Delaware, where many corporations set up shop. iShares is the name of BlackRock's ETF division. The filing was done by BlackRock Advisors, a division of the world's largest asset manager. (The company incorporated the iShares Bitcoin Trust in the state a week before it officially filed paperwork for a spot BTC ETF in June.)BTC had been around $35,200 before the surge, and after the ETH news emerged, it started heading back toward that level, tanking to about $36,400.The extraordinarily volatile period resulted in a massive leverage wipeout, liquidating $241 million of short positions and roughly $200 million of longs during the day for all crypto assets combined, CoinGlass data shows.Crypto liquidations in a day (CoinGlass)Liquidations mean that the exchange forcefully closes a leveraged trading position due to the partial or total loss of the trader's money down, or doesn't have enough funds to keep the trade open. The dynamic can exacerbate volatility as traders cover their positions and flushes out excessive leverage from the market.Thursday saw the largest amount of liquidations in a day since Aug. 17, when cryptocurrencies sharply sold off with BTC dropping to as low as $25,000 from around $29,000, with liquidations totaling $1 billion.Open interest, or OI, the total amount of open options and futures contracts held by market participants, for crypto derivatives plunged below $24 billion from over $26 billion, per Coinalyze data, as traders dismantled or were forced to close their leveraged positions.\"12% (-$3b) Total OI wipeout in a few mins on the anniversary of the FTX collapse,\" widely followed crypto trader Hsaka posted on X (formerly Twitter). \"Poetic.\"Edited by Nick Baker."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest Prices(CoinDesk)Top StoriesBitcoin topped $37,000 in the U.S. morning after it neared that level in Asian trading hours to create a \"short squeeze\" that drove prices higher. Just under $50 million of bitcoin shorts (bets against the price rising) were liquidated in a four-hour period, extending the BTC rally. Short squeezes occur when the price of an asset jumps higher than expected and short sellers are forced to cover their positions, driving the price higher still. Exchanges with a large Asian presence such as BitMEX, OKX and Binance accounted for large chunks of the exited positions. Bitcoin's bullish momentum followed reports late Wednesday that the U.S. SEC is beginning talks with fund manager Grayscale, with whom it has been engaged in a legal fight over the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF.Shares of U.S. crypto-centric companies ticked upward in pre-market trading, riding the momentum of the latest rally in BTC and reflecting the fresh optimism of a spot bitcoin ETF finally being approved in the U.S. Coinbase was up about 4% as of around 6.00 ET, while MicroStrategy, the software developer that holds over 150,000 BTC on its balance sheet, rose almost 5%. Mining firms Marathon and Riot advanced around 9.8% and 6% respectively. Robinhood showed more restrained gains of 2.5%, having dropped 14% on Wednesday after reporting big drops in its revenue and trading activity.Standard Chartered's venture arm and SBI Holdings are forming an investment company with $100 million backing to target crypto startups.

        "content": "The U.S. Treasury recently announced a slower-than-expected pace of 10-year and 30-year bond sales, capping the upside in the 10-year yield, a positive outcome for cryptocurrencies and other assets.Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal has strengthened amid worsening economic and geopolitical issues.Unless you have been underwater for the past week, you have probably heard about bitcoin (BTC) rising to 18-month highs above $36,000, mainly on hopes of one or more exchange-traded funds (ETF) getting approved.The so-called spot ETF narrative is hogging the limelight, perhaps rightfully so, as the eventual launch is expected to bring billions of dollars in investor money into the market.That said, there are at least two other bullish, underappreciated tailwinds supporting upside in the cryptocurrency. Let’s discuss those in detail.U.S. Treasury’s refunding strategyThe U.S. Treasury has long been releasing a “quarterly refunding announcement,” publishing its plans for bond issuance/sales over three months. Markets rarely noticed the announcement in recent years.But the latest Nov. 1 release was closely watched as markets feared the Treasury would step up the issuance of longer-dated bonds to handle the burgeoning debt load.Such an outcome could have seen the yield on the U.S. 10-year note, the so-called risk-free rate of return, establish a foothold above the much-feared 5% mark, disincentivizing investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other assets. All else equal, less bond supply means upward pressure on prices and downward pressure on yields.However, the Treasury said it plans to borrow less than anticipated in Q4, announcing a slower-than-expected pace of 10-year and 30-year bond sales.Since then, the yield on the 10-year note has declined from 4.93% to 4.52%. It could drop further in the coming weeks, thanks to Treasury’s slower debt sales and hopes the Fed’s tightening cycle has ended. On Friday, the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data missed estimates, weakening the case for continued rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.Safe-haven appealBitcoin has more than doubled this year, in line with its record of beginning new bull trends in 12 or more months leading up to the reward halving. The fourth halving is due in March/April 2024. The latest cycle, however, looks different than previous ones, thanks to bitcoin’s strengthening safe-haven appeal, according to Noelle Acheson, author of the widely-followed Crypto is Macro Now newsletter told CoinDesk.In other words, considering the economic and geopolitical risks, the path of least resistance for BTC is higher. A safe haven asset appreciates or retains its value in terms of economic or geopolitical crisis.While the U.S. economy still appears resilient, a slowdown is increasingly likely. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its 2024 global growth forecast to 2.9% from its July forecast of 3.0% while expressing concerns over geopolitical tensions, China’s property market issues, and commodity volatility.The recent conflict in the Middle East suggests the cold war between the U.S., China, and Russia is escalating, according to geopolitical strategist Velina Tchakarova.That could worsen economic issues, boosting demand for censorship and seizure-resistant assets like bitcoin.“One of the big differences between this cycle and the previous one is the strength of the “safe haven” narrative. Back in 2021, the tailwinds were mainly liquidity and speculation on the ETF impact - this time, they are ETF speculation and a deepening understanding of the safe haven narrative, at a time one, is regretfully needed,” Acheson told CoinDesk.“Safe haven has several meanings: for many who need to ensure their assets are seizure-resistant, a digital bearer asset is ‘safer’ than fiat in a bank account or even gold, which is hard to transport. For others, “safe” means a provably hard supply limit at a time when governments are going to have no choice but to dilute [fiat] currencies,” Acheson added.Central banks worldwide have begun cutting rates, a development that could dilute their respective national fiat currencies and boost demand for alternative assets like BTC.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

In other words, demand for calls or bullish bets is outpacing puts, offering downside protection.With spot ETF optimism driving BTC above $36,800 on Thursday, investors have likely stopped selling calls above the cryptocurrency's spot price, a popular strategy to generate additional yield on top of coin holdings.Meanwhile, speculators could be buying call options to have leveraged upside exposure. Longer duration call-put skews also show a bias for continued BTC strength over two, three, and six months.Long call (buy call option) trades account for 44% of the total activity on the leading exchange Deribit in the past 24 hours.

Other large-cap digital assets are also in the green, with ether (ETH) up 20% in the last month.While bitcoin’s gains this year have been impressive, and some have attributed this to the widely expected approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, in a recent interview with CoinDesk, Matt Hougan, Bitwise Asset Management’s Chief Investment Officer, said that an ETF is not yet priced in.\"It’s not at all priced in because the people who are going to buy this ETF are not aware that it’s coming or most likely coming; the majority of advisors who are the natural audience for this ETF don’t expect it to come until 2025 or later,” Hougan said. “If the people who are going to buy this ETF don’t think it's going to be approved in the next two months, then I don’t see how it’s priced in.”ETFs, Hougan argued, will play a significant role in opening up cryptocurrency investments to a broader range of investors, particularly financial advisors who manage a substantial portion of the U.S.' wealth.Currently, crypto has been bought by 20% of self-directed retail investors, he said, but a full 80% of the wealth in America is controlled by financial advisors and institutions, who need an ETF to access crypto.\"There’s a whole entire new audience for bitcoin,” he said, comparing it to the launch of gold ETFs in the early 2000s.“The approval of a spot gold ETF in 2004 led to eight or nine consecutive years of gold price increases, the longest in its modern history since the dollar’s creation,\" he continued.Hougan said that BlackRock’s filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in June had a significant psychological impact on the market, effectively dispelling the lingering negative sentiment from the FTX collapse, which he refers to as the “ghosts of Sam Bankman-Fried.”“When BlackRock filed for a bitcoin ETF, and CEO Larry Fink spoke on Fox Business News about bitcoin transcending other currencies, concerns vanished,” he said.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Users are required to use the Binance app to create a wallet, with the app serving as the venue for activities such as staking, lending and borrowing. The wallet will also use multiparty computation (MPC), which involves a private key being broken into three parts of which the wallet owner controls two, as a means of removing the need to memorize seed phrases. The new wallet appears to compete with TrustWallet, which the exchange bought in 2018. TrustWallet's native token (TWT) fell following Binance's announcement. TWT had experienced a positive week prior to this, thanks in part to Binance listing TWT futures on its exchange, which saw volume increase from around $80 million to $476 million on Monday.HSBC said it plans to start a custody service of tokenized securities for institutional clients alongside Swiss crypto custodian Metaco. The service is set to go live in 2024 and will complement HSBC's existing platform for digital asset issuance and its recent tokenized physical gold offering, the bank said. HSBC pointed out that the service will not pertain to cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Tokenization, the process of issuing and trading real-world assets on blockchains, is one of the most prominent ways in which major financial institutions are becoming involved in the digital asset industry.

        "content": "Just as green shoots are appearing in crypto markets, a new data set has emerged showing just how dramatically the pace of blockchain development slowed recently.The amount of new token creation dropped during the third quarter to the lowest since at least the start of 2021, according to blockchain smart-contract auditor CertiK. The company created the data set by using the list of tokens added each quarter to the tracking website CoinMarketCap, and then stripping out so-called memecoins that serve no ostensible purpose but to provide yuks and a vessel for speculation.Some 293 new tokens were added in the third quarter, down from 366 in the second quarter and 449 in the year-earlier period, according to the data. During the height of the bull market in cryptocurrencies in the fourth quarter of 2021, some 1,261 new tokens were created.The numbers are consistent with separate reports illustrating the depths of so-called crypto winter. A report last month from the digital-asset firm Galaxy noted that venture-capital funding for crypto and blockchain projects slid last quarter to the lowest since late 2020.\"It may still be a sign of crypto winter where everyone has paused developing and launching, waiting for the arrival of spring,\" said Ronghui Gu, CertiK's co-founder, who is also an assistant professor of computer science at Columbia University in New York.Decline in liquiditySeveral blockchain projects have had to cut staff, with NFT marketplace OpenSea being the latest to do so, announcinga 50% reduction on Nov. 3, with the CEO writing in a post on X that the company was \"building a new foundation.\"\"It's probably partially due the general decline in liquidity in the industry,\" said Sean Farrell, a crypto analyst at the independent investment-research firm FundStrat. \"No one wants to list a token when there there is a lack of risk-taking.\"But the price of bitcoin staged a powerful rally in October, and major altcoins have also been on the rise, fueling speculation that the worst of the market malaise might be over.Last week, funds for investing in cryptocurrencies attracted some $767 million of fresh money, marking the best six-week stretch since the 2021 bull market.The recent drop in token listings may reflect, to some degree, a maturation of the crypto industry, FundStrat's Farrell said.\"There are more legitimate projects out there now, so the battle for that incremental liquidity is tougher,\" he said. \"The bar for launching a token is higher.\"Some would-be issuers may have been deterred by the risk of running afoul of regulators – a heedfulness that may not have existed in prior eras of the 14-year-old crypto industry.\"The regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. has discouraged many projects from launching tokens,\" Farrell said.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies appear to have staying power, Federal Reserve’s Chairman Jerome Powell said in June. Perhaps truer words have never been spoken, as the market value of all cryptocurrencies has doubled to $1.3 trillion this year, recovering from last year’s crash.More impressive is the renewed interest in centralized crypto-collateralized finance after last year’s controversial collapse of industry giants BlockFi, Celsius, and others.“Since the soft launch of our lending offering on Sept. 13, we’ve been surprised by how much demand there is for crypto-secured loans,” Alexander Blume, managing partner at SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, told CoinDesk.“We have seen about $2 billion in demand for bitcoin-secured loans since we started offering them in September,” Blume said.Crypto-collateralized lending is an arrangement where a borrower pledges bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or other digital assets as security and primarily draws the loan in the form of fiat currencies. In case a debt goes bad, the lender usually, as the contractual authority, liquidates the pledged crypto asset to recover the amount loaned.The loans are typically overcollateralized, meaning the value of the collateral is far greater than the loan’s value. It ensures the lender has some cushion to protect against losses from a potential decline in the value of the collateral asset.Crypto-backed fiat loans are preferred during bullish market trends as rising prices boost the value of the collateral while the borrower deploys the fiat loan to purchase other cryptocurrencies or buy mining equipment, usually denominated in U.S. dollars.The arrangement allows miners or investors to keep their crypto holdings while sourcing additional fiat money to fund operations and yield-generating strategies.CeFi platforms like BlockFi, Celsius and Voyager saw tremendous growth during the 2020-21 bull runs before last year's crypto market crash exposed the lack of proper risk prevention measures at these lending giants. At its peak, Celsius had over $20 billion worth of assets under management and more than 1.7 million users.The three firms declared bankruptcy last year, freezing depositors’ accounts and their ability to withdraw their money. The episode drew the ire of U.S. regulators.\"After the fall of Genesis, BlockFi, Celsius, and others, a major gap in the market emerged for responsibly managed secured loans for institutions. Two Prime is well-positioned to fill it,\" Blume said, adding that we are focused on institutional borrowers.About 85% of the fiat loans extended by Two Prime so far are collateralized by bitcoin, while the rest are secured by ether and other larger alternative cryptocurrencies.Interest rates vary based on loan-to-value ratio, duration and size, but generally range from 5% to 12%, Blume said.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Safe haven asset gold sank to its lowest price in three weeks, while West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) plummeted 4% to its weakest level since July. The Nasdaq 100 advanced 1.1%, now on a seven-day winning streak.What's next for bitcoin (BTC)?As bitcoin's price stays increasingly compressed in the range between $34,000 and $36,000, capital rotation into altcoins is creating a \"mini altcoin season,\" a K33 Research report noted.It's a typical behavior on the crypto market that traders take profits after a sizable BTC rally and put the proceedings in smaller, riskier tokens.At the same time, K33 pointed out, accelerating inflows into bitcoin-related funds provides support for BTC's price.\"It’s hard, nearly impossible, not to remain bullish,\" K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde said. \"An ETF verdict is nine weeks away, and institutional traders provide the only significant heater witnessed in the derivatives market.\"\"November represents yet another solid month for aggressive accumulation of bitcoin, with an extended plan to distribute, reduce exposure, and reallocate to altcoins once the cat’s out of the bag,\" Lunde added.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

New research by McClellan Financial Publication shows sudden spikes in open interest, or the number of active contracts, in these cash-settled futures, hints at trend changes in bitcoin’s price.Open interest in CME’s standard BTC futures, also known as large futures, has increased by 35% to 19,603 ($3.4 billion) in four weeks, according to CFTC’s Commitment of Traders report. The standard contract is sized at 5 BTC ($173,000) and is considered a bell weather for institutional activity.The double-digit rise in open interest in a short period means bitcoin’s ongoing uptrend could soon run out of steam, paving the way for a price pullback. The cryptocurrency has gained over 25% in four weeks to trade near $35,000.“The fascinating aspect of total open interest in bitcoin is that every once in a while, it sees a spike in a relatively short amount of time. When that happens, it nearly always marks a turning point for bitcoin prices. It can be a top or a bottom,” Tom McClellan, editor at The McClellan Market Report, said in an email to subscribers on Friday.Spikes in open interest have historically marked major and interim turning points in the market. (Tom McClellan) (Tom McClellan)The chart shows spikes in open interest have historically marked trend changes, including the bull market top of late 2021 and the bear market bottom of November 2022.Taking lessons from goldBoth bitcoin’s recent price appreciation and the surge in open interest likely reflect expectations the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon greenlight one or more spot-based BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs).Most analysts expect a U.S.-based spot ETF to bring billions of dollars in new investor money, pushing BTC’s market value skywards.That said, expected flows may not materialize immediately, leaving the doors open for a post-launch price slide, as observed following the debut of ProShares’ bitcoin futures ETF (BITO) in October 2021. A similar pattern played out in the gold market in the 1970s.“Speculators are rushing in ahead of that anticipated surge in demand, just as they rushed in ahead of BITO's approval only to see it top. The same dynamic occurred with gold when it was finally authorized public ownership in 1975,\" McClellan said.Gold prices tanked from $186 per ounce in December 1974 to $110 by August 1976 as the expected rush into the yellow metal did not pan out.“The lesson here is that those who are chasing into bitcoin now on speculation about the impending ETF approval are likely going to end up like those 1974 gold speculators, and like the earlier bitcoin speculators who topped bitcoin prices as they rushed in ahead of the debut of BITO [futures-based ETF],” McClellan added.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

She contrasted this to the opaque inner workings of the banking system.\"You can only surmise because they're losing deposits and they have to fund those by selling securities,\" Wood said. \"The deposit flight has not stopped and they're forced to raise interest rates to compete against money market funds.\"Wood reminded of the regional bank crisis in the U.S. in March when a handful of lenders collapsed, helping to send bitcoin's price higher by nearly 50% to $30,000.\"[Now] you see it pumping up again and you see the regional bank index in the U.S. breaking below where it was in March.\"Wood was echoing comments she made in May that the banking crisis along with the collapse of crypto exchange FTX a year ago had \"proved the concept\" of bitcoin as they exposed the dangers of centralization in financial systems.BTC's reputation as a potential inflationary protection investment is in step with the crypto's comparisons to digital gold. While Wood acknowledged that actual gold can also work as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, she maintained that bitcoin would be her choice \"hands down\" if she had to choose an asset to hold for the next 10 years.\"Gold already has its demand, it's happened.

Grayscale and CoinDesk are part of the same parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG).XRP has spiked in the past 24 hours to become the top-performing crypto major as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) held steady. Prices rose over 11% before slightly retreating on Monday, with trading volume jumping to $2 billion from Sunday’s $1 billion, CoinGecko data shows. At the time of writing, XRP traded at 69 cents and had replaced BNB as the fourth-largest token by market capitalization. Data suggests the gains were largely spot-driven as liquidations on XRP-tracked futures breached just over $4.4 million. A large liquidation amount may suggest that the use of high leverage may have boosted prices.The Bank of England (BOE) will regulate “systemic stablecoins” that are in wide enough circulation to potentially disturb financial stability, while the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will oversee the wider crypto sector according to discussion papers published by the two regulators Monday.

Still, market sentiment remains positive, with weak data signaling an end of the Fed tightening.“There’s no reason not to be bullish BTC,” Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amerdata, said in an email, citing Friday’s payrolls figure and the recent decline in stock market volatility indices as the likely catalyst for continued gains in the cryptocurrency.The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report on Friday showed that job creation slowed to 150,000 jobs in October after rising by 297,000 in September.Meanwhile, the jobless rate rose to 3.9% while wage growth, as measured by average hourly earnings, softened, hinting at continued disinflation.The data has made it more likely that the Federal Reserve will not hike interest rates again, supposedly a positive development for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The central bank has raised rates by 525 basis points to 5.25% since March last year. The so-called tightening aimed at taming inflation was partly responsible for last year’s crypto market slide.“This [NFP] print was also accompanied by revisions lower for both September (+336k→ +297k) and August (+227k → +165k). We’re also seeing decent progress on the CPI and hourly earnings trends, giving room for the Fed to speak in a continued dovish tone,” Magadini noted.Supporting the case for continued upside in bitcoin is the dwindling volatility in the U.S. stock and bond markets. The S&P 500 VIX indicator has tanked from 21.13 to 14.19 in the past five trading days, while the MOVE index, an options-based measure of volatility in the Treasury bond market, has dropped from 132 to 118, according to charting platform TradingView. Perhaps tensions in the Middle East are no longer the focal point for the market.Reduced volatility in traditional markets, especially bonds, alleviates liquidity stress in the global market, incentivizing risk-taking.\"The Middle Eastern war (something beyond my understanding) seems to have taken a backseat in terms of market-driving news.

The SEC in October notably failed to appeal the ruling, helping to lead to current expectations of coming approvals.Leinweber notes that bitcoin, as a decentralized entity, certainly doesn't hinge its existence on an ETF, but “a rejection would undeniably cast a bearish shadow on bitcoin’s price in the short term.”“I believe that the absence of an ETF would impose a substantial drag on the crypto market,\" he said. \"It would necessitate a period of adjustment and realignment, as the market would need to decouple and forge a new narrative moving forward.\"Other crypto assets such as ether (ETH) would likely not be immune to these repercussions, according to Leinweber, especially considering that the SEC would next shift its focus to the spot ether ETF applications.Bullish action goes beyond ETF“In the case that a spot ETF isn’t approved soon, we believe Bitcoin’s 2024 investment case remains very strong,\" said Hashdex’s CIO, Samir Kerbage. \"More investors are beginning to appreciate the benefits of bitcoin as a store-of-value asset or type ofdigital gold.”Kerbage also noted that the next Bitcoin halving is approaching and “if history once again rhymes, the price of BTC will react positively to this scheduled reduction in supply.\"“Regardless of when a spot bitcoin ETF is approved, the outlook for the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency has never been stronger,\" he concluded.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

However, scars from the collapse of FTX and Alameda are still evident in the form of weak liquidity and market depth, which is the market's ability to absorb large orders at stable prices.The combined 2% market depth for bitcoin, ether (ETH), and the top 30 alternative cryptocurrencies by market value is currently $800 million, 55% lower than a year ago, Dessislava Aubert, research analyst at Paris-based Kaiko, said in an email.In other words, a year ago, it would have taken an order worth at least $1.8 billion to move prices 2% in either direction. Currently, an order of $800 million is enough to influence prices.The substantial deterioration in liquidity, referred to as the Alameda Gap by Kaiko, means higher slippage costs for traders looking to execute large orders. Slippage refers to the difference between the expected cost of a trade and the actual cost of execution. Weak liquidity also means a few large orders can have an outsized impact on prices and breed price volatility.Before it went bust, Alameda was the industry's leading market maker, providing billions of dollars in liquidity in bitcoin, ether, and alternative cryptocurrencies. FTX was the third-largest perpetual futures exchange by open interest and trading volumes.The 2% market depth struggles to recover from the crash seen a year ago after FTX and Alameda Research went bust. (Kaiko) (Kaiko)The chart shows market depth for bitcoin improved to $350 million in October from $250 million in the third quarter. The cryptocurrency surged 28% in October, the biggest single-month percentage gain since January.The rally in the market leader, however, did not improve the liquidity situation for ether and alternative cryptocurrencies.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

Bitcoin miners, said Saylor, need to sell bitcoin in order to keep the lights on, and he noted those sales are currently running at about $1 billion per month. The halving – expected to occur in April 2024 – however, means miners will soon have only half of that available to sell.\"You're going to see $12 billion of natural selling per year converted into $6 billion of natural selling per year,\" he said. At the same time, he noted, spot bitcoin ETFs are going to be a source of increased buying pressure.Secondly, there are soon to be new rules implementing fair value accounting for company bitcoin holdings. \"Long term,\" said Saylor, \"this is going to open the door for corporations to adopt bitcoin as a treasury asset and create shareholder value with their balance sheets.\"Read more: FASB Says Crypto Assets Should Be Marked at Current ValuesFinally, Saylor addressed the current news cycle, including the fraud trial of former crypto wonder-kid Sam Bankman-Fried. \"Early crypto cowboys, the crypto tokens that are unregistered securities, the unreliable crypto custodians\" were liabilities for bitcoin, he argued.\"For the industry to move to the next level,\" said Saylor, \"we need to migrate to adult supervision.

Results are similar to the recently published NASDAQ survey that highlighted that over 70% of advisors hold crypto currently and would invest more for themselves upon approval of a bitcoin spot ETF; however, less than 10% feel comfortable advising their clients on this asset class. See the summary of results below.Happy reading.– S.M.You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.Why Advisors Should Not Wait for the Spot Bitcoin ETFWhile access to a bitcoin investment might be easier with a spot bitcoin ETF, Advisors could miss a significant opportunity if they wait for approval. Advisors with access to investment vehicles right now (Crypto SMAs) have the unique ability to “front run” larger institutions for maybe the first time in history, positioning clients to benefit from bitcoin’s historical four-year price cycle in a tightening bitcoin supply environment.Cyclical Price Action Within a Secular Growth TrajectoryBitcoin has followed a four-year cycle, with price reflecting the waxing and waning sentiment of an emerging innovation/asset class. Significant drawdowns have been followed by parabolic years of growth. These cycles demonstrated similarities in sentiment, price action and regularity.As seen below, historically bitcoin has followed a pattern of three years of impressive gains followed by a significant drawdown in price. This cycle is driven by the natural changing of sentiment of an emerging asset and solidified by the underlying mechanics of bitcoin’s known code.Every four years, the new supply of bitcoin entering the market is cut in half in an event known as the Bitcoin Halving. All else equal, this incremental reduction in the pace of bitcoin supply growth puts upward pressure on the price of bitcoin from a demand/supply balance standpoint and builds the narrative around the four-year cycle with media attention highlighting the critical characteristic of bitcoin’s fixed monetary policy. Bitcoin was down 65% last year and is over 100% YTD in the first year of a potential new cycle, with the next halving slated for April 2024.Strike Before the Iron is HotWith bitcoin at a favorable price relative to its historical four-year cycle and looming positive catalysts, advisors who have access to bitcoin should take this time to strike before the iron is hot, to get out in front of the institutional inflows and before the barriers to a bitcoin investment are lowered.A spot bitcoin ETF approval and progress toward broader regulatory clarity around crypto could propel the next bull market, allowing latent demand to enter the market. By utilizing today’s available tools, such as Crypto SMAs, advisors can take advantage of the disconnect in the market between underlying demand and actual investment flows.Further, bitcoin’s supply on exchanges is low by historical standards as investors in bitcoin are holding their bitcoin for longer and longer (41% of bitcoin supply has been held over three years compared to 27% in 2017), limiting the actual supply available to trade and increasing the price impact of any surge in bitcoin demand.With technical and fundamental catalysts lining up for the next bitcoin bull run, advisors waiting for a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF may miss the boat. While a spot bitcoin ETF might help legitimize an allocation to bitcoin in the eyes of the broader investing public, there are more efficient investment vehicles to own bitcoin.Direct Ownership is The WayDirect ownership is the best structure from an investment vehicle perspective and is available now. There is minimal tracking error compared to other products, such as an OTC public trust, which can have meaningful premiums and discounts and, thus, tracking error. Further, there is 24/7 liquidity for crypto SMAs, allowing investors and advisers to sell or buy anytime.The second and arguably more important reason is that direct ownership is in the clients’ best interest in the long term. An advisor who takes the time to position their clients in a favorable investment vehicle for a given asset class, even though it requires extra effort, will build a reputation for putting clients’ needs first. Further, this will showcase domain expertise relative to advisors who are not knowledgeable about the crypto market. A new asset class requires innovative infrastructure and education. The client will value the upfront work of advisors who utilize a Crypto SMA, increasing the trust in the relationship.Slowly, Then SuddenlyBitcoin will continue to take on the ups and downs of an emerging asset and deal with roadblocks in the form of bad actors, regulatory hurdles, misconceptions, and the volatility of an emerging innovation. To be sure, there will be more bumps ahead with volatile price movements and potential price drawdowns. Further, a bitcoin ETF approval could be a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" event.We view bitcoin as not a trade but a generational opportunity with the upside materializing over a long-term investment horizon for three, five or 10 years. But that doesn’t mean advisors have the luxury to wait for a spot bitcoin ETF. With arguably better investment vehicles available, a lining up of favorable tailwinds for bitcoin price, a potential deluge of new capital flowing to bitcoin, and a tightening supply of bitcoin, now is the time for advisors to make a prudently sized allocation to bitcoin, before the institutions for once.– Christopher King, Founder & CEO, Eaglebrook AdvisorsBitcoin ETF SurveyDuring the past two weeks we asked advisors to partake in a survey focused on their investment interests for bitcoin spot ETFs. The results are in.Slightly more than 50% of respondents stated YES, they would invest in a bitcoin spot ETF when approved in the US. 15% said NO; the remainder of respondents were based outside the U.S. Interestingly 82% said they would personally invest in a bitcoin spot ETF with the other 18% saying they would not.When asked, “What would be the reason you would not allocate clients into a bitcoin spot ETF? (check all that apply),” 32% of respondents selected “lack of understanding and education,” 28% selected “inappropriate risk profile for your clients,” 17% selected “availability at your firm's product shelf” and 28% selected “other” with write-in responses including “not suitable for clients aged over 65,” “prefer income-producing assets,” “inconsistent with investment mandate” and “BTC doesn't offer the commercial utility of other alt coins.”As 32% of respondents selected, “lack of understanding and education,” please note there are several courses and designations designed to help you learn and use digital assets. The CDAA and DACFP are two such designations.Thank you to everyone who responded to the survey.

The impressive gain could be attributed to several reasons, including spot ETF optimism, speculation the Federal Reserve’s liquidity tightening cycle has peaked and haven demand. The expected 65% price rise means bitcoin could trade above $65,000 by the year-end.“Based on these statistics, bitcoin continues to offer upside potential, and a +65% year-end rally would lift prices back to $56,000,” Thielen added.If Bitcoin is up at least +100% by this time of the year, then there is a +71% it will rally further by 65% or more by Dec. 31 (Matrixport Technologies) (Matrixport Technologies)The chart shows the historical performance of bitcoin in the first ten months and the final two months of the year from 2010-2022.In seven out of the past 12 years, bitcoin scored at least 100% gains in the first 10 months. In these seven years, bitcoin rallied by an average of 65% in the final eight weeks.“When bitcoin is up at least +50% by the end of October, there is, on average, a 78% chance that bitcoin will advance even more into year-end.

        "content": "Put options or bearish bets tied to bitcoin (BTC) are trading at a discount to historical standards, offering a rare opportunity for bulls to snap up downside hedges at cheap valuations.The conclusion is based on the ratio between two metrics – implied volatility for 25-delta out-of-the-money (OTM) BTC put options and the 30-day implied volatility (IV) of at-the-money (ATM) options. The ratio has dipped below 1.00, according to data provided by Amberdata.It’s a sign that 25-delta put options listed at strikes below bitcoin’s current market price are undervalued in volatility terms relative to those at strikes near the spot price.Implied volatility, traders’ collective expression of expected price turbulence, reflects demand for options. Professional traders often quote and compare options’ valuations in implied volatility terms.A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, while a call buyer is bullish. Traders with bullish exposure in the spot/futures market often buy puts as a hedge against potential price correction.The ratio has dropped below 1, hitting the lowest since at least late 2021. (Samneet Chepal) (Samneet Chepal)The latest discount comes as traders scramble to add bullish exposure through calls amid bitcoin’s price rally. The cryptocurrency topped the $36,000 mark early today, extending October’s 28% gain.That said, the window of opportunity to buy cheap hedges could be short-lived, as puts have rarely traded at a discount since early 2022.“Put IV seldom dips below ATM IV, let alone for extended periods. Despite the current bullish market sentiment and reduced demand for downside protection, it’s difficult to imagine a scenario where BTC puts consistently maintain a discount relative to ATM volatility,” Chepal told CoinDesk.“This prompts us to question whether this phenomenon will persist in the weeks to come,\" Chepal added.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Recent wobbles in financial markets, some softening economic indicators and a new leg higher in geopolitical tensions, however, could give the Fed an opening to back away from the idea of any more rate hikes.Bitcoin's strong October breakout from the $27,000 area has been stalled in the $34,000-$35,000 area for the past week, perhaps awaiting fresh fuel. While any dovish signal from the Fed could provide a push out of that range, few are expecting it. “We still see another U.S. rate increase as unlikely in the current cycle,” Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, told CNBC. \"As a compromise, we think that the Fed will stress that rate cuts are not on the cards anytime soon, with easing to begin no sooner than the second half of 2024.\""

These FOMO phases are characterized by both retail and savvy traders pouring money into an already-trending asset in fear of missing out on a significant opportunity.Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the RSI measures the speed and change of price movements and oscillates between zero and 100. The default period for calculating RSI is 14 days, but traders use 14-week and 14-month RSIs to gauge long-term momentum.A reading above 70 is often erroneously taken to represent overbought conditions and a sign of an impending bearish reversal. However, per technical analysis textbooks, an above-70 RSI, especially on longer duration charts, suggests bullish momentum is strong and the asset could continue to rally in the weeks ahead, similar to what happened in 2019 and 2020.To paraphrase a Wall Street saying, indicators can stay overbought longer than bears can stay solvent.Traders, however, should note that macro developments can single-handedly make or break technical chart patterns and should be vigilant of potential black swans.Edited by Stephen Alpher."

For decades, investors have treated government bonds, particularly those issued by the U.S. Treasury, as safe havens.Recently, however, the Treasury bonds have failed to live up to their reputation.At 4.9%, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note is at least ten basis points higher than where it was a day before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. In other words, the price of the 10-year note has declined, a sign of investors seeking safety in other assets. Bitcoin has risen 23% to $34,460 since Oct. 7.“We haven’t seen the flight to quality of flight to safety that you would expect given what’s happening in the world,” El-Erian said, noting the uptick in the 10-year yield since the outbreak of tensions in the Middle East.The Treasury bond market has seen higher volatility this year, with yields charting sharp two-way moves in recent weeks due to uncertain government bond auctions, concerns about the economy, federal debt and the Fed’s policy path.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) could see rapid price gains once it tops the $36,000 mark, the recent positioning of options market makers suggests.Options are derivative contracts, offering the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call or a bullish bet gives the right to buy, while a put confers the right to sell.The demand for higher strike price call options has recently increased, with bitcoin rallying nearly 27% in the past four weeks. That has left market makers with a significant net short gamma exposure above $36,000, according to data tracked by Amberdata and Galaxy Digital. Options gamma is the rate that delta will change based on a $1 change in bitcoin’s price. Delta measures the sensitivity of options prices to the change in bitcoin's price.When market makers or dealers are net short gamma, they buy the underlying asset in the spot market as its value increases to stick to their mandate of maintaining an overall delta or market-neutral exposure. The hedging activity often accelerates the rally, often called a “gamma squeeze,” and likely played a role in BTC’s recent quick ascent from $30,000 to $35,000.“If BTCUSD moves higher to $35,750-$36,000, options dealers will need to buy $20 million in spot BTC for every 1% upside move, which could cause explosiveness if we begin to move up towards those levels,” Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, said on X.Dealers or market makers are entities tasked with creating order book liquidity and are always on the opposite side of investors’ trades. They make money through the bid-ask spread and always strive to maintain a direction-neutral portfolio.The present positioning of market makers and its expected impact on the spot price contrasts the situation early this year when market makers were net long gamma and bought low and sold high in the spot/futures market to keep their books neutral. That further added to the volatility lull in the market.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

It has recently resided just above $34,000 ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday, with market participants largely expecting policymakers to leave rates unchanged.The rally spread across the broader crypto market, a bullish sign, The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks a broad basket of tokens, advanced 22% in October. The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies jumped nearly 19% to $1.255 trillion, according to TradingView data, the biggest increase in crypto wealth since the 33% jump in January.ETFs would be a big deal for bitcoin because they're far easier for the average investor to buy than the cryptocurrency itself or existing bitcoin investment products, like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) with $21 billion assets under management. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected GBTC's conversion into one, but courts have eviscerated that decision, boosting the odds the SEC will have to approve that shift – and likely also bless ETF applications from the likes of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.Despite the fact that it was a broad crypto rally in October, not all sectors benefited equally.The CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF), which encompasses tokens related to the decentralized finance sector such as decentralized exchanges, lending and staking protocols, gained only 7% in October. Key DeFi tokens such as curve (CRV), maker (MKR), uniswap (UNI) and compound (COMP) declined 3% to 7%.Crypto sector returns in October (CoinDesk)Ethereum's ether (ETH) posted a modest gain of 7%. Its valuation sank to a level versus BTC that was also seen in June 2022, which preceded ETH outperformance.Meanwhile, the CoinDesk Computing Sector (CPU), an index that tracks protocols focused on building and supporting Web3 infrastructure and distributed computing, jumped almost 32% in October.Among alternative cryptocurrencies, solana (SOL) was a notable outperformer with over 70% monthly return amid increasing network activity and subsiding concerns about FTX dumping tokens in a fire-sale.Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Started Buying Solana's SOL at 20 Cents Using 'Alameda Profits,' He Says at His TrialWhy did cryptocurrencies rally in October?Investors are excited about the potential for bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.\"A spot bitcoin ETF could bring in as much as $50 billion to $100 billion in inflows over the next five years\" and \"could have an outsize impact on the price of bitcoin,\" Ryan Rasmussen, analyst at asset manager Bitwise, said Tuesday in an interview with CoinDesk TV.He said he expects the SEC to green light ETF applications as soon as December, before the holidays. Bitwise is one of the firms that wants to list one.UnmuteCrypto investment services firm Matrixport said that elevated funding rates on the BTC derivatives market suggest that many traders \"panic bought\" on the way up in a fear of missing out of the rally.On top of the ETF hype, sector specific momentum, short liquidations and macroeconomic headwinds also contributed to the price increase, crypto analytics firm CoinMetrics said in a report Tuesday.\"This market movement suggests renewed confidence and indicates a potential shift in the dynamics around digital asset markets,\" CoinMetrics analyst Tanay Ved said.BTC rallied in October on a confluence of catalysts (CoinMetrics)Highlighting a shifting sentiment, investment legend Stanley Druckenmiller said at a Robin Hood fireside chat Monday with hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones that he \"likes\" bitcoin and gold as an investment and store of value asset. He said he owns gold because it's a \"5,000-year-old brand,\" but young people prefer to own BTC because it's \"easier to do stuff with.\"\"I don't own any bitcoin, but to be frank, I should,\" he added.What's next for bitcoin (BTC) price?After its blockbuster month, bitcoin hasn't run out of steam and could run further, analysts suggested.\"The October breakout to a fresh yearly high has opened the door for this next major upside extension, targeting a measured move objective in the $40,000 area over the coming weeks,\" Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in an email.Matrixport analysts noted that the firm's Bitcoin Greed & Fear Index sits at 97%, signaling \"exuberant\" sentiment.

As we celebrate this day in Bitcoin culture, it's worth reflecting on the significance of the white paper and its impact on the world.The Bitcoin white paper, officially titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" emerged following the global financial crisis of 2008, which left many disillusioned with traditional banking.Nakamoto's vision was clear — to create a currency free from the shackles of governments, make it censorship-resistant and borderless. All solutions to the problems of then and the problems of now.So Satoshi began – for two years before drafting the white paper its creator coded writing, \"I actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself.\"[Bitcoin] is synonymous with words like hope and freedomIn just nine short pages, the document outlined the blueprint of a decentralized ledger called the blockchain and introduced the concept of bitcoin as a currency. Its ingenious solution to the double-spend problem was to create a decentralized network of computers that would validate and record transactions in a public ledger, making it impossible to manipulate transactions.Since 2008, Bitcoin has not only survived but thrived, becoming a global phenomenon and the best performing asset of the last decade. It sparked a wave of innovation within cryptocurrencies, it attracted and inspired people such as Vitalik Buterin and others to attempt at making more programmable protocols.See also: Aubrey Strobel: The Art of Scarcity | OpinionThe currency has established itself as a store of value, digital gold and a hedge against inflation in some countries. Its scarcity, capped at 21 million coins, has drawn interest from all walks of life. It has differentiated itself much from the crypto space and is synonymous with words like hope and freedom.While many are celebrating the arbitrary movement of time that has passed since the document was sent loose, today I want to reflect on how Satoshi could have known that we needed this invention and how to carry on his legacy.Many of the same problems Satoshi set out to address remain current today. How can we move the mission of decentralized, permissionless money forward? How will we use the tools at our disposal to move the chain forward in the next 15 years? What problems can we solve?The resurgence in Bitcoin Builder culture is palpable. You see it with Ordinals and other projects coming to the surface. How do we take Bitcoin to a billion people?If cypherpunks are akin to participants of the Boston Tea Party, the Bitcoin white paper is the guiding light — a reminder for those challenging the times. What will we do in the next 15 years?"

That summer day, Nakamoto had registered the bitcoin.org domain name, indicating perhaps the first time the pseudonymous cryptography expert realized he may be onto something. By Halloween Day, the day the Bitcoin white paper was first sent out to a cryptography mailing list, announcing the project to the world, Nakamoto had hard-coded the entire project.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.“I actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper,” Nakamoto wrote on Nov. 11, 2008. He was responding to cryptography mailing list subscriber Hal Finney, the receiver of the first bitcoin transaction, who in 2004 had built a reusable proof-of-work system that inspired Bitcoin.Of course, there’s evidence suggesting that Nakamoto had had the idea far earlier than 2008. For instance, in an early 2010 email to Jon Matonis, a former VISA executive, congratulating him on a blog post Matonis wrote about the long development of electronic money, Nakamoto said he wished “there was something like that when I originally researched this three years ago.”“Bitcoin would be right up your alley,” Nakamoto said. Matonis would go on to become a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation.At the time, Nakamoto discussed Bitcoin in a few narrow ways. Although he often responded to interested potential users, or did outreach himself trying to bring the revolutionary technology in front of cryptography fans, hardcore coders and libertarians Nakamoto presented Bitcoin as a fairly utilitarian and spartan project. When someone created the first Wikipedia page for Bitcoin in July 2010, Nakamoto said it was too “promotional” for his taste.“Just letting people know what it is, where it fits into the electronic money space, not trying to convince them that it's good,” Nakamoto added.Bitcoin is, as Nakamoto described it, an electronic, peer-to-peer currency-like system. It could “become” a currency so long as people ascribe value to it, and that could happen for any number of reasons like wanting to collect interesting things or needing an alternative to using credit cards online, he had suggested. “Bitcoins have no dividend or potential future dividend, therefore not like a stock,” he wrote.” “More like a collectible or commodity.”Read more: Nick Baker - On Bitcoin White Paper's 15th Anniversary, Wall Street Threatens to Swallow Its One-Time ChallengerBut the chief innovation Nakamoto knew from the beginning was that Bitcoin has no central issuer, or “mint,” as he sometimes called it. “There isn’t a central mint or company running it. As long as there are users, it survives,” he wrote in that 2010 email to Matonis. Someone so deeply involved in the digital currency space of the ’90s knew that experiments like DigiCash and LibertyReserve failed because there was a person or company in the middle to become compromised.This is a revolutionary idea, of course, and the first of many cryptocurrency experiments to follow that replaced “trust intermediaries” with certain cryptographic guarantees and the collective empowerment of users. Users gave bitcoin its value, and they are incentivized to see the network grow. At the time, Nakamoto thought Bitcoin might be useful for small transactions like micropayments, which “massive overhead costs” at banks make impossible, as well as international transfers or private payments.Not all of Nakamoto’s early ideas panned out. Micropayments have failed to materialize, and today it’s painfully obvious how unfit a fully-public network like Bitcoin is for privacy. But he was right that Bitcoin would grow to become a real alternative to trust-based finance. Today, the total value of bitcoin in circulation is worth over $672 billion and financial institutions from BlackRock to VanEck want in.See also: What Will Wall Street’s Bitcoin Narrative Be? | OpinionBitcoin abstracted away the trust that is inherent in the modern money system, where banks and other financial institutions keep track of all the transactions that flow through and ultimately decide which were valid and who could use the system. Bitcoin is as much a public broadcast system as it is a currency network, which allows anyone, anywhere to validate and verify the blockchain on their own.Or, as Nakamoto told Wei Dei, the inventor of another Bitcoin progenitor, b-cash, it solves the “double-spend” problem and other issues of trust in money by using a “peer-to-peer network” that “timestamps transactions” and “hashes them into an ongoing” chain “that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.” Nakamoto had reached out on Friday, Aug. 22, 2008, to ask Dei how he should be cited in the Bitcoin white paper.CORRECTION (Oct. 31, 2023, 15:38 UTC): Fixes spelling of Wei Dei's name.Edited by Ben Schiller."

The surge comes after last year’s downturn when investors speculated the future of Solana after the collapse of the ecosystem’s top backer, FTX, threw the blockchain’s future in disarray. The Solana community is currently hosting its annual conference Breakpoint in Amsterdam. According to a growth report on Solana by Messari, “if Solana’s growth story is to continue, a constant stream of new experiments will have to flood in, with a few grand slams finding product market fit.” Bitcoin witnessed a 23% gain in October after hitting a 16-month high of $35,000 on Oct. 23. Ether had a less impressive month, gaining just 3%. Chainlink’s LINK followed behind Solana with a 42% uptick over the same period.Sam Bankman-Fried’s attorneys are trying again to have the jury overseeing his trial consider the role of English law in governing FTX’s terms of service, hoping it may lead to a “not guilty” verdict on some of the fraud charges the exchange founder faces. “For misappropriation to have occurred, under the Government’s theory, there must have existed a trust, fiduciary relationship, or a similar relationship between FTX and its customers,” a filing including a proposed jury instruction said. The proposed jury instruction would tell the 12 individuals deciding Bankman-Fried’s fate that “FTX’s relationship with its customers was governed by the Terms of Service,” which are \"governed by ... English law.” An additional set of filings provides example cases from the U.K.Bitcoin (BTC) miners are evolving into industrial-scale enterprises, with North America gaining market share over China, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday as it initiated coverage of the sector in the U.S. Bernstein says it prefers Riot Platforms [RIOT], giving it an outperform rating and a $15.60 price target, and also rated CleanSpark [CLSK] outperform with a $5.30 price target. These miners are “market share consolidators with strong operational edge (self-mining model), low cost of production (low power cost), high liquidity and unlevered balance sheets,” wrote analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra.Chart of the DayThe total value locked in layer 2 scaling solutions has hit a new record high of nearly $12 billion, surpassing the previous peak of $11.8 billion.Layer 2 networks accounted for two-thirds of transactions on Ethereum in the third quarter.Source: L2Beat- Omkar GodboleTrending PostsBitcoin’s 'Triangular Consolidation’ Is Bullish: Technical AnalysisDaniel Shin Blames Terraform Collapse on Do Kwon’s Management: ReportSpain Brings Forward MiCA Crypto Rules by Six Months After EU PressureEdited by Parikshit Mishra."

Triangles tend to be continuation patterns, representing a pause that refreshes the preceding trend, which is bullish in BTC's case. The leading cryptocurrency rallied from $26,500 to $35,000 before starting its triangular behavior.\"Bitcoin is forming a triangle on the daily chart. It is generally believed that such consolidation formations end with an upward breakout,\" Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.According to Kuptsikevich, a move above $35,000 would confirm a bullish triangle breakout, signaling a continuation of the rally from $26,500.Note that while triangles usually resolve in the direction of the preceding trend, they can sometimes end with a downside breakout, indicating a bearish trend reversal. Hence, it's imperative traders closely follow the price action over the next few days.Edited by Sheldon Reback."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade above $34,000 after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) softened its grip on the “yield curve control” (YCC) program, counteracting the Federal Reserve’s liquidity tightening.At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value changed hands at $34,300, representing a 0.18% drop on a 24-hour basis, CoinDesk data show.On Tuesday, the central bank kept the short-term policy rate steady at -0.1%, continuing its negative interest rate policy. However, the BOJ said it would consider the 1% upper bound for the 10-year government bond yield as a “reference” rather than a hard cap. This tweak will allow for more yield fluctuations and relieve the pressure on the BOJ to step in with liquidity-boosting bond purchases every time the 10-year yield tests the erstwhile 1% hard cap.Bitcoin is known to track changes in global fiat liquidity, and the Japanese central bank’s YCC has been a significant source of liquidity since 2016.The BOJ’s move is consistent with Monday’s Nikkei report, which said the bank will take a more flexible stance, allowing the benchmark yield to rise above 1%. The U.S. dollar-Japanese yen (USD/JPY) pair has bounced back to 150 from 149.20, a sign the overnight Nikkei report had traders expecting the BOJ to move the hard cap to 1.25% or 1.5%.Per some observers, BOJ’s latest tweak represents a stealth move away from the dovish YCC program, which calls for caution on the part of traders of liquidity-sensitive risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.“Key paragraph from the BOJ - 1% is now the “soft” upper limit (reference) and won’t be enforced as strictly. That, and the upward revision to inflation forecasts, means this is THE most hawkish BOJ has been in a while...just not as hawkish as the Nikkei leaks suggested,” rates strategist Rishi Mishra said on X.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged the BOJ to abandon YCC and prepare for eventual tightening or rate hikes.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

        "content": "If you were paying attention back then, you don't need to be told this, but for those who were not: Late October 2008 was an incredibly ugly time in money, markets and finance.Major firms, most famously Lehman Brothers, had just collapsed or required bailouts. Many others were teetering, and the stock market was tanking. Governments and central banks were trying to contain the catastrophe. And I wasn't sleeping well, tangled up in covering the carnage at Bloomberg News.Oct. 31, 2008, is also when the Bitcoin white paper came out – now 15 years ago to the day. Ensconced in traditional finance, I didn't notice the cryptocurrency revolution had begun, nor had the rest of what we now call TradFi; the financial system appeared to be burning down, after all – we were busy.Satoshi Nakamoto's paper didn't explicitly say: The world needs a peer-to-peer system to move money around to replace Wall Street giants because they can't be trusted, they're falling apart, etc. But that was the vibe as folks picked up on the idea and made the Bitcoin blockchain and bitcoin (BTC) the cryptocurrency real.Bitcoin got switched on, BTC started getting mined and stuff started happening – small stuff at first. Pizzas were purchased. A website morphed from a place to swap Magic: The Gathering cards to a giant crypto exchange – and then got massively hacked. Other cryptocurrencies debuted, expanding what blockchains could do. Crypto prices soared – like, really soared – as idealists who embraced the idea of decentralization and cutting out middlemen in finance harnessed Satoshi's ideas, made them real and extended them. (More than a few charlatans got involved as well.)Wall Street and the rest of TradFi started paying attention – trying to move conventional financial operations onto blockchains and trading \"digital assets,\" their genteel term for cryptocurrencies.Read more: What Will Wall Street's Bitcoin Narrative Be?Today, we find ourselves at an ironic moment. These titans of finance are increasingly driving a space that, to many, was designed to put them out of business.Take, for instance, the story of the moment (excluding Sam Bankman-Fried's ongoing criminal fraud trial). Giddiness over BlackRock (the biggest asset manager in the world) and some of its peers trying to list bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. pushed up bitcoin's price last week, a bet that these easy-to-trade products will bring a flood of investment into BTC. BlackRock and other ETF providers look poised to be – assuming regulators permit these products, and there are reasons to think they'll have to – the new bitcoin whales.Read more: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Seeing Client Demand for Crypto 'Around The World'Also, CME Group, owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, is close to overtaking Binance as the largest crypto derivatives exchange in the world. (CME's product is a cash-settled futures contract, essentially a side bet on bitcoin's price; no BTC changes hands). In other words, a business with roots in the 19th century and agricultural commodities like corn and pork bellies, and one of the key spots in all of traditional finance, is a major player in crypto trading.That said, this is less about how much of the total BTC stash that Wall Street holds. Finance people are increasingly taking over the story – at least to the mainstream – around bitcoin, to an extent that is noteworthy.What does TradFi muscling its way to the front of the pack mean for crypto?First, an asterisk: Bitcoin ETFs and crypto derivatives trading (much of it involving BTC) don't mean finance bros are swallowing all of crypto. Bitcoin is not all of crypto – though its market capitalization as a percentage of the whole crypto market is at an unusually high level above 50%.There are the myriad blockchains like Ethereum and its associated layer-2 networks such as Polygon that run smart contracts – software designed to power various financial and other applications – and that have their own tradable tokens.That's a whole largely decentralized realm (in aspiration, if not always in practice) that, even to some in TradFi, represents a way to replace conventional ways of doing finance with blockchain-powered versions. That fits broadly with Satoshi's peer-to-peer vision, even if some of the folks that have adopted this mindset collect Wall Street-sized paychecks.Which brings us back to the irony. Whether bitcoin and crypto folks like it or not, TradFi is coming/is already here – though the degree of their involvement will hinge on regulators' desires, and they're clearly not psyched, judging, for instance, from the actions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and banking agencies.Crypto will still have its crypto-y moments, like last week when the price of a totally normal token called HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu zoomed higher.\"We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust,\" Satoshi wrote 15 years ago.After Sam Bankman-Fried, Do Kwon and Alex Mashinsky showed what can happen when you trust crypto natives, are users prepared to trust different crypto shepherds? Or will they finally ditch the shepherds, as Satoshi might have hoped?Edited by Marc Hochstein."

Meme coins are making a comeback. And the chastening trial of Sam Bankman-Fried is almost over, giving crypto the chance to start anew.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.UnmuteAs we head into winter in North America, is “crypto winter” just about done?It certainly looks like it.Crypto winter isn’t quite a technical term (like a “recession” is a fall in economic output for two successive quarters). There’s no accepted definition. But anyone who is in crypto knows what it is and what it feels like. During winter, crypto prices are falling, crypto’s critics are on the warpath, VC dollars dry up and everyone’s looking for a new narrative.Recently, that new narrative has returned.Wall Street is getting into bitcoin in a big way, promising billions in new investment through ETF vehicles. The story is now about how mainstream institutions are going to save the digital assets industry, by making tokens safe for investors and bringing greater regulatory clarity. In the wake of FTX and other major scandals, it is said that the adults are coming back into the room, promising more focus on what actually works. Wall Street’s agenda now is about finding sustainable products. It’s all about ETFs, tokenized securities and stablecoins. Not the fluff-and-nonsense of meme coins and over-priced NFTs that we saw during the COVID-era run-up.You may not like the new narrative, believing it departs from the purpose and origin story of crypto (which was to provide an alternative to mainstream finance). But it’s assuredly the reason why people are getting excited about crypto again.Part of this is driven by macro factors, like the instability of the Middle East and the renewed threat of inflation. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, described the recent rally in bitcoin as being driven by a “flight to quality” – the hunkering of investors for safety in times of uncertainty.See also: What Will Wall Street’s Bitcoin Narrative Be? | Opinion“I think there are more people running into a flight to quality whether that is in treasuries, gold or crypto – depending on how you think about it. And I believe crypto will play that type of role as a flight to quality,” he told Fox Business earlier this month.Fink, of course, used to be an avowed crypto skeptic, someone who was more interested in Bitcoin’s environmental footprint than its potential as a safe-haven asset. Now this bellwether Wall Street figure is trumpeting Bitcoin live on national TV. And actually crypto winter may have ended before last week, if we’d paid more attention. Warmer times were already on the way back in January, according to Noelle Acheson, the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, who now writes the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter.“Since [January], we've had significant regulatory progress outside the U.S., big legacy banks building crypto teams, new funds emerging with significant capital, broader tokenization experimentation and the deepening participation of both financial and technology giants in blockchain-related services,” she tells me over email.“It is true that the interest pick-up has been tentative in some quarters, and the regulatory landscape in the U.S. does not look warm and sunny, but for the crypto ecosystem as a whole, the ‘green shoots’ of spring have been evident for months,” she adds.“Since January, new layer 1s have emerged, layer 2 value has more than doubled, Google/Mastercard/Fidelity and other household names are diving deeper into crypto services, massive fund managers have tokenized products, and the largest asset managers in the U.S. are looking to create crypto-linked products. That is not at all wintery.”For investors and industry participants in the market who are still underwater, it may not seem like crypto winter has ended at all. But, squint squarely enough, and you might be able to see how market conditions are improving. There are sure to be ups and downs along the way, yet the trajectory for the industry now seems upwards rather than sideways and down."

Still, the market shows no signs of overheating, a positive sign for traders anticipating unabated gains, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.The firm’s view is based on an on-chain indicator called the market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio, which measures the spread between bitcoin’s market capitalization and realized capitalization.The ratio currently stands at 170% or significantly lower than the 300% threshold, historically marking major market tops.\"The bitcoin market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio shows that despite reaching yearly highs, bitcoin is not as overheated yet as during previous bull markets,\" blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock said in the weekly newsletter.“Historically, bitcoin bull markets have peaked around 300%+ MVRV, which, in comparison to the current 150% value, suggests the bull market has room to run further,” IntoTheBlock added.The ratio is nowhere close to the feared 300% threshold. (IntoTheBlock) (IntoTheBlock)Market capitalization refers to the total dollar value of the supply in circulation, as calculated by the daily average price across major exchanges. The realized value, considered a relatively better gauge of fair value, approximates the value paid for all existing coins by adding the market value of coins when they change hands through an on-chain transaction.Very high values indicate bitcoin's market price is overvalued relative to its realized or fair value, while extremely low values suggest otherwise.Another factor suggesting bitcoin's peak may be higher than the recent high of $35,000 is the low investor interest in trading meme cryptocurrencies like SHIB.While bitcoin has surged 27% this month, the notional open interest or dollar value locked in the number of active SHIB perpetual contracts on Binance remains flat at around $35 million, according to Coinglass data. Past data show that bitcoin peaks when meme coin frenzy grips the market, with open interest in SHIB rising above $100 million.That said, investors should be vigilant about the potential escalation of geopolitical tensions and continued oil rally, with prices topping $100 per barrel. These developments could lead to broad-based risk aversion and put downward pressure on bitcoin.“Macro forces and potential black swans could bring a correction following the recent appreciation,” IntoTheBlock noted.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

Notional open interest refers to the U.S. dollar value locked in the number of active or open contracts.Keeping the top spot is the offshore unregulated exchange Binance, with an open interest of $3.83 billion.

Similarly, the CME’s share in the BTC futures market rose to a new lifetime high of 25%.CME’s standard bitcoin futures contract is equivalent to 5 BTC, while the micro contract is sized at one-tenth of 1 BTC. The standard ether futures have a contract size of 50 ETH, while micro futures are equivalent to one-tenth of 1 ETH. Most open interest in offshore exchanges is concentrated in perpetual futures rather than traditional futures contracts. Perpetuals are futures with no expiry and use the funding rate mechanism to keep perpetuals in sync with the spot price.Per some observers, CME’s ascent is a sign of an institutional-led rally. Bitcoin has risen 27% this month amid lingering macroeconomic uncertainty and spot ETF optimism.Retail investors, too, seem to have played their part, as evidenced by the uptick in the futures-based ETFs. The rolling five-day volume in ProShares’ industry-leading bitcoin futures ETF jumped by a staggering 420% to $340 million last week, according to data provided by Matrixport. The ProShares ETF invests in the CME bitcoin futures.André Dragosch, head of research at Deutsche Digital Assets, suggests otherwise. Per Dragosch, CME’s rise results from the unwinding of bearish bets on offshore exchanges.“CME’s share in $BTC futures OI might have increased relative to other exchanges, but the aggregate amount of BTC futures & perps OI has not increased in BTC terms, implying that long futures positions were not the main driver behind the recent surge,” Dragosch said on X.“Price spike was rather induced by short squeeze w/ a reduction in aggregate open interest,” Dragosch added.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."

CPU saw over 17% gains, driven mainly by tokens of Chainlink (LINK) and Fetch.AI (FET).Even the laggard decentralized finance (DCF) and digitization (DTZ) sectors were up over 7% this week, highlighting the breadth of the crypto rally.Performance of crypto sectors (CoinDesk)Notable best-performing cryptocurrencies include notorious meme coin pepe (PEPE) with 76% advance following a token burn, LINK rallying over 44% which benefitted from the tokenization of real-world assets trend and finance-focused Injective Protocol's native token (INJ), adding another 58% gain to its already-impressive run following a token upgrade this August.Crypto's 'uptober' and big tech’s demiseWhat has made crypto's bullish week even more significant is the dismal performance of U.S. equities, Coinbase analysts David Duong and David Han noted.Read more: Bitcoin Catches Market Cap of Elon Musk's Tesla Amid ETF-Fueled Rally, but Traders Cautious Ahead of Fed MeetingThey pointed out that BTC moved 4.3 standard deviations higher this week compared to the previous three months, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq moved nearly 2.5 to 3.0 standard deviations lower during the same time, the Coinbase report said.\"That massive divergence partly reflects a deteriorating macro trading environment juxtaposed against bitcoin’s positive idiosyncratic story,\" Duong and Han wrote.Bitcoin, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Z-scores (Coinbase)\"Uptober is certainly living up to its name,\" Charlie Morris, founder of investment advisory firm ByteTree, said in a Friday market update.Morris noted that the tech-heavy Nasdaq's slump amid BTC's and gold's advance signals a shift in the investment landscape away from the ever-growing, large U.S. tech giants.\"Big tech is expensive, and following underwhelming results this week, the sector no longer grows fast enough to justify premium prices,\" he said. \"Admittedly, they had plenty of room to reduce costs, but real growth comes from sales rather than costs.\"\"It’s the end of an era, and tech investors should jump ship,\" he added.Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."

        "content": "When crypto mining is discussed in the U.S. Congress, it's often tied to claims that mining operations are environmental parasites, sapping finite energy resources. But representatives of that sector flooded offices on Capitol Hill this week to argue their businesses can help stabilize the power grid, tie into renewable resources and foster domestic technology.Executives representing more than 40 mining operations and their lobbyists hit dozens of offices in the House of Representatives on Thursday, focusing on members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\"The core message that we're delivering to congressional offices today is that bitcoin mining is helping achieve and advance America's energy security and national security,\" said Perianne Boring, CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, which organized the Digital Power Network that conducted the lobbying event.Last year, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) led other lawmakers on a probe of crypto's effects on the vulnerable Texas energy grid. Warren and environmental groups have criticized the sector's high energy use as a threat to the global climate.\"We have seen a lot of misunderstanding about bitcoin mining and energy policy,\" Boring said, adding that the companies in their House meetings shared real-world examples of the technology becoming part of the U.S. energy infrastructure.\"The negative impact of the energy usage debate wasn't as pronounced as I had anticipated,\" Galaxy Digital's former head of mining Amanda Fabiano, who is now an industry consultant and participated in the event, said in a posting on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). She noted that the arguments that resonated with lawmakers included the jobs mining creates and the advancement of U.S. innovation.Sanjay Gupta, head of strategy at Auradine, a Silicon Valley tech company, focused a lot of his discussions on restrictions and import tariffs on Chinese technologies in the space. He said the U.S. already limits \"access of sensitive high technology to Chinese companies,\" but his company's priority was \"to ensure that that's enforced.\" Reports of China-tied crypto facilities in the U.S. have raised some alarms.Boring said the industry is also supporting a bill from Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) that would establish the House sees proof-of-work bitcoin mining as beneficial.Read More: Ethereum's Lifetime Energy Use Before the Merge Equaled Switzerland's for a YearEdited by Aoyon Ashraf."

        "content": "The euphoria around what’s now expected to be regulatory approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing helped aid the crypto’s surge of nearly 20% in the past week.Bitcoin’s (BTC) move higher came as technology stocks continued their decline despite a number of mega-cap names – Amazon, Google and Facebook among them – reporting better-than-hoped earnings results. The Nasdaq Composite is now lower by more than 10% from its July high, putting the tech-heavy index in correction territory.This is notable as bitcoin in the past has shown a strong correlation with U.S. equity markets, but now appears to be decoupling. The largest cryptocurrency is currently posting more than a 100% gain year-to-date, with options activity reaching historic highs.Bitcoin’s market capitalization of about $670 billion is now roughly on par with Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA) and tops that of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (LLY).Were it a U.S.-listed stock, bitcoin would rank as the ninth-largest by market cap, just behind that of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, data from CompaniesMarketCap shows.Traders have mixed opinions ahead of FOMCMeanwhile, traders remain cautious about an extended price surge in the weeks ahead, pointing to the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday.“The market’s atmosphere could drastically change,” analysts at Japanese exchange Bitbank shared in a note with CoinDesk. “Recent economic data have demonstrated the U.S. economy’s strength, so a likely scenario is that the Fed will keep its policy rate unchanged but chair Powell will try to counter market’s expectation that rate hikes are over at his press conference.”“This is why bitcoin’s potential significant upside risk has a short expiration date: it could print another leg up in the next couple of days and then enter a correction phase, or it could stay at the current level until next week’s FOMC and then start to pull back,” continued the analysts, led by Yukari Kusu.FxPro market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich, however, gave a differing view of FOMC expectations in a Friday note to CoinDesk.“The crypto market is holding its total capitalization above $1.27 trillion despite a frightening sell-off in equities overnight,” Kuptsikevich said. “Bitcoin and other major altcoins are once again attempting to play the role of safe haven.”“There is also possible speculation that market turbulence in the week leading up to the FOMC meeting will force the regulator to soften its tone significantly, which is positive for crypto unaffected by the falling revenues from Google's cloud business or similar stories,” he continued.Edited by Stephen Alpher and Nick Baker."
